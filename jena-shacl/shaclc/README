== SHACLC parser

The SHACLC parser translates shaclc syntax into an RDF graph (rather than
creating the shapes tree directly).

To make the SHACLC parser:

Run the script 

   shaclc-parser

which runs javacc to create the parser in

../src/main/java/org/apache/jena/shacl/compact/reader/parser

and cleans up the output files to remove or surpress Java warnings.

The generated javacc java is checked into git so you don't need to install
javacc to build this module unless you want to change the parser.

== To produce BNF HTML

Run the parser generator - shaclc-parser

Produce the tokens.txt file.

The script 'jj2tokens' will do bulk translation but the output needs fixup and
replacing some rules with better format.

Run shaclc2html

This produces X.html, the HTML table between HTML comments for GRAMMAR and
Y.html a displayable HTML file with styling.

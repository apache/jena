== SHACLC parser

The SHACLC parser translates shaclc syntax into an RDF graph (rather than
creating the shapes tree directly).

To make the SHACLC parser:

Run the script 

   shaclc-parser

which runs javacc to create the parser in

../src/main/java/org/apache/jena/shacl/compact/reader/parser

and cleans up the output files to remove or surpress Java warnings.

The generated javacc java is checked into git so you don't need to install
javacc to build this module unless you want to change the parser.

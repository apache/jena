 * Adapter that wraps a source of RDFLinks with builders that mimic those of for DatasetGraphs.
 * The adapter thus returns {@link QueryExecDatasetBuilder} and {@link UpdateExecDatasetBuilder} views
 * over the link source.
 *
 * The life cycle of links is as follows:
 * For queries, a link is only created when {@link QueryExecDatasetBuilder#build()} is called. The link is closed
 * with the corresponding QueryExec is closed.
 * For updates, a link is only created during {@link UpdateExec#execute()} and closed when this method completes.

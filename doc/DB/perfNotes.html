<h1>Jena2 Database Interface - Performance Notes</h1>



<h3>28 August, 2003</h3>



  <p>Very little tuning or performance analysis has been done. However, a simple
  performance comparison of Jena1 and Jena2 on both memory and persistent models
  was performed using the jena-perf benchmark (available 
  from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jena/">
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/jena/</a>). This showed Jena2 to be up to three times 
  faster than Jena1 (see <a href="perftestWin32.html">PerfTest</a>). 
  However, Jena2 models may consume more disk space than Jena1 models. This is due to the different table layouts used in Jena1 and 
  Jena2 (see <a href="perftestSpaceWin32.html">PerfTestSpace</a>). In Jena1, all resources
  and literals were stored in separate tables that were referenced 
  from the statement table. This greatly reduced space 
  consumption since resources and literals that appeared in multiple statements 
  were only stored once. However, retrieving a statement required joining the 
  statement table with the literals and resources tables.</p>



<p>In Jena2, <i>short</i> resources and <i>short</i> literals are stored directly in the statement table.
  Separate tables for resources and literals exist but are only used for <i>long</i>
objects
  whose length exceeds some threshold. The threshold has a database-dependent 
  default but may be redefined by users (see <a href="options.html">LongObjectLength</a>). Consequently, Jena2 requires fewer join operations than 
  Jena1 at the expense of greater memory consumption. Reducing the value of
  LongObjectLength can reduce disk space consumption. Jena2 offers another
  mechanism to reduce disk space consumption. Often, resource URIs have common
  prefixes. By default, URIs are stored fully expanded in statement tables.
  However, the <a href="options.html">DoCompressURI</a>&nbsp;option can be used
  to compress URIs by storing common prefixes in a separate table and encoding
  the URI in a statement table with a reference to the prefix table.</p>



  <p> For loading large databases, two techniques can be used to reduce load
  time. First, if the dataset to be loaded 
  contains no duplicate statements, the option 
  <a href="options.html">DoDuplicateCheck</a> &nbsp;may be used to disable checking for duplicate statements on 
  insertion. Another option is to manually delete the database indexes and then 
  recreate them after the loading has completed. Unfortunately, Jena2 does not 
  currently support a utility to do this on behalf of users. We cannot provide 
  any guidance on the benefit of deleting and recreating the indexes and mention 
  it only as an option users may wish to try if load performance cannot be 
  improved through other techniques.</p>



  <h2><a name="dbengines"><span style="background-position: 0 0">Effect of 
  Database Options on Loading</span></a></h2>



  <p>A simple study was conducted to determine the effect of some of the 
  database options on database space and load time. A synthetic test data set 
  consisting of 1000 Dublin Core documents was loaded under various 
  configurations. This data set contains 22,000 RDF statements with no duplicate statements. Some property values
  are long. The tests were run 
  using MySQL on WindowsXP. For this data set, the table below shows how the
  various option settings enable trade-offs between space and time. The results
  should not be considered representative because the impact of these option
  settings is dependent on the characteristics of the data set. Although this
  table only shows individual option settings, these options may be set in any
  combination.</p>

  <p>Some preliminary experiments were done to determine the impact of indexes 
  during database loading. It was speculated that dropping the indexes prior to 
  loading and recreating them afterward would be faster than loading with 
  indexes. The thinking was that database engines (some of them, at least) have 
  good algorithms for creating indexes as a batch operation so that creating an 
  entire index at once would be significantly less expensive than updating the 
  indexes for each statement added.</p>



  <p>However, our initial experiments with MySQL showed no significant benefit 
  to dropping and recreating the indexes. The load without indexes was 
  significantly faster than loading with indexes. However the overhead and 
  dropping the index (there was significant overhead to dropping the index when 
  the table was already populated) and recreating the index approximately 
  equaled the savings. We will continue these experiments with different engines 
  and database configurations but for now we can provide no recommendations.</p>



  <h2>Reification Performance</h2>
<p>The Jena2 persistent reification code is new and typical application usage 
patterns are not yet known. However, based on preliminary testing, we can make 
some recommendations for improved application performance. <br>
<br>
Recall that Jena supports two mechanisms for adding a reified statement (see the
<a href="../how-to/reification.html">Reification HowTo</a>). The RDF 
standard represents a reified statement as four individual statements and these 
statements may be added individually to a model. Jena will internally convert 
these back to the original reified statement. Alternatively, Jena supports a 
createReifiedStatement method (on the Model class) that adds a complete reified 
statement with one call. We recommend using this method for persistent models. It is significantly faster to add reified statements 
using createReifiedStatement rather than adding the four statements 
individually. If one is using the Graph interface rather than Model, the Reifier 
interface for graphs supports a method similar to createReifiedStatement. Adding 
a fully reified statement using these optimized methods takes approximately the 
same amount of time as adding a single non-reified statement - it is four times 
faster than individually adding the four reification statements.<br>
<br>
When creating a new Model, Jena2 now provides several different reification 
styles. For persistent models, we recommend using the <a href="../how-to/reification.html">
Standard</a> reification style if you have a choice. There is very little 
performance difference between the styles. However, Standard is more powerful (supports 
queries over the reified statements), is consistent with the RDF standard (has 
no unexpected behaviour), uses no more space than the other styles and operates 
at similar speeds.<br>
<br>
If you have a mix of reified and non-reified statements it may be convenient to 
simply create two models, using one for just the reified statements. This allows 
you to query while ignoring the reified statements and may give a small 
performance gain in future implementations. We are looking at optimizing the 
special cases of models with only reified statements, or only non-reified 
statements. In fact, <a href="fastpath.html">Fastpath</a> already 
supports this optimization for RDQL query processing as an option.<br>

  <h1><span style="background-position: 0 0">Comparing Jena2 and Jena1 database 
  systems</span></h1>
<h2><a name="compatibility"></a>Compatibility with Jena1 ModelRDB and 
  Databases</h2>



  <p>In general, Jena2 supports backwards compatibility for the Jena1 
  applications using the <font face="Courier New" size="2">ModelRDB</font> 
  class. However, the Jena1 databases themselves are not compatible and cannot 
  be directly read by Jena2. Instructions on migrating Jena1 databases to Jena2 
  are given <a href="#migrating">below</a>.</p>



  <p>There are some changes to the API. <font face="Courier New" size="2">The 
  ModelRDB</font> constructors are deprecated and applications should consider 
  migrating to new factory methods for creating and opening persistent models 
  (see the <a href="../creating-db-models.html">HowTo</a>). The <font face="Courier New" size="2">
  ModelRDB</font> package name has changed. Jena1 applications that directly 
  reference the package name jena.rdb must be modified to reference the package 
  name
  <font face="Courier New" size="2">jena.db</font>. Jena2 does not support the <font face="Courier New" size="2">
  StoreRDB</font> class nor any of the Jena1 customization parameters (setProperty, 
  getProperty). Jena2 uses a different technique for database configuration.</p>



  <p>Jena2 does not support the <i>hash</i> layouts and <i>proc</i> layouts of 
  Jena1. Applications that request these layouts under Jena2 will be given a 
  generic layout. Jena2 supports MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL. Applications that 
  require Interbase&nbsp; will not work. A Jena driver for Berkeley DB is 
  available; see ModelJEB on the Jena <a href="../../contrib/contributions.html">
  contributions</a> Web page. The driver configuration files (e.g., Mysql.config) 
  are no longer used. Instead, get/set methods on the driver and modelRDB 
  classes are used for configuration parameters (see <a href="../options.html">
  Options</a>).</p>



  <p>In Jena2, all databases are multi-model. By default, models are stored 
  separately and each model uses one table for asserted statements and another 
  table for reified statements. To share tables among models, see
  <a href="#migrating">migrating</a>, below.</p>



  <p>Performance of Jena2 persistent models is no worse than Jena1 and often 
  better. However, Jena2 persistent models may consume more database space. See 
  the performance notes (<a href="perfNotes.html">PerfNotes</a>).</p>



  <h2><a name="migrating"></a>Migrating Jena1 Applications and Databases to 
  Jena2</h2>



  <p>As mentioned above, most Jena1 persistent applications should run with 
  little or no modification under Jena2. However, the <font face="Courier New" size="2">
  ModelRDB</font> class constructors are deprecated. In Jena2, persistent models 
  should be created using a factory method. In some situations, the ModelRDB 
  class constructors are still required because the factory methods do not yet 
  support all the ModelRDB functionality (see
  <a href="../creating-db-models.html">HowTo</a>).</p>



  <p>The Jena2 persistence architecture and layout are different from Jena1. 
  However, these differences are largely transparent to applications and only 
  affect code that creates new persistent models. In particular, the way in 
  which database configuration options are specified is changed. In Jena2, 
  configuration options are specified using get and set methods on models or 
  drivers. See <a href="../options.html">
  Options</a> for details on using them.</p>



  <p>There is no utility provided to migrate databases. However, users can 
  easily create their own. A small Jena1 application program is used to write 
  Jena1 <font face="Courier New" size="2">ModelRDB</font> contents to a text 
  file using an RDF writer. Then, a small Jena2 application program is used to 
  read this file and store it in a <font face="Courier New">persistent</font> 
  model. For small databases, the PrettyWriter (RDF/XML-ABBREV) should be 
  adequate. For medium or large databases, use the N-Triple writer for better 
  performance and consider using a pipe to connect the two small applications 
  rather than using an intermediate file.</p>

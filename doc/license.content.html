This is used to produce some of the source files
in the directory com.hp.hpl.jena.iri.impl,
i.e. the files Lexer*.java,
from source definition files.
The license terms for JFlex are 
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>.
No JFlex distribution (either source or binary) is included
with the IRI distribution. If you need to regenerate the
Lexer*.java files: 
<ul>
<li>refer to AbsLexer.java, and PatternCompiler.java,</li>
<li>download JFlex 1.4.1</li>
</ul>
This step is not needed, either to run or compile the Jena IRI Library.
The files Lexer*.java, are covered under the  Jena license,
under the terms of the JFlex license, specifically:
<pre>
The code generated by JFlex inherits the copyright of the specification it
was produced from. If it was your specification, you may use the generated
code without restriction.

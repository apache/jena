<h1>The Jena FileManager and LocationMapper</h1>

<p>
The FileManager is a utility to find and read files into models.
There is a standard global FileManager and applications may also define
specific ones by constructing addition FileManagers.</p>

<p>The LocationMapper provides alternative locations for RDF data.</p>

<h2>The File Manager</h2>

<p>Files are named by a string, according to the conventions of their
storage system. Typically this is by URI.  There are a number of storage
system adapters provided:
<ul>
<li>File locator (with own current directory)</li>
<li>URL locator</li>
<li>Class loader locator</li>
<li>Zip file locator</li>
</ul>
The global file manager has a file location, a URL locator and a
class loader (tried in that order).</p>


<p>A FileManager can have an associated LocationMapper that transforms
names before use.  This means local copies of documents can be used
transparently to the rest of the application.</p>

<p>There are two categories of operations: loadModel, readModel. Load
operations fetch and parse the data into a new memory model.  Read
operations fetch and parse the data into an existing model.  For more
complex ways to create a new model see ModelSpec
(<a href="../javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/rdf/model/ModelSpec.html">ModelSpec javadoc</a>).
</p>

<p>Each FileManager has an optional in-memory cache of models.
When on, loading models will look in the cache first and return
a cached model if possible.  This cached model is not copied -
updates <i>will</i> change the cached version.  The default is that cache is off.</p>

<p>In fetching and parsing a file, the file manager will attempt to guess
the serialization format, if not explicitly supplied.  This is by name
extension:
<ul>
<li><code>.rdf</code> and <code>.owl</code> : RDF/XML</li>
<li><code>.n3</code> : N3</li>
<li><code>.nt</code> : N-Triples</li>
<li>Anything else: RDF/XML</li>
</ul>

<h2>The LocationMapper configuration file</h2>

<p>This example uses the RDF subset of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/Primer">N3</a>.
Jena has an RDF reader and RDF writer for N3.
This is nearly the same as
<a href="http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/2004/01/turtle/">Turtle</a>
but allowing international characters and some restrictions due to N3.</p>

<p>Location mapping files are RDF - they may be written in RDF/XML, N3
(file suffix <code>.n3</code>) or N-Triples (file suffix <code>.nt</code>).
The default is RDF/XML unless one of these suffices is found.</p>

<pre class="box">
[] lm:mapping
   [ lm:name "file:foo.n3" ;     lm:altName "file:etc/foo.n3" ] ,
   [ lm:prefix "file:etc/" ;     lm:altPrefix "file:ETC/" ] ,
   [ lm:name "file:etc/foo.n3" ; lm:altName "file:DIR/foo.n3" ]
   .
</pre>

<p>There are two types of location mapping: exact match renaming and
prefix renaming.  When trying to find an alternative location, a LocationMapper
first tries for an exact match; if none is found, the LocationMapper
will search for the longest matching prefix.  If two are the same length,
there is no guarantee on order tried; there is no implied order in a location
mapper configuration file (it sets up two hash tables).
</p>

<p>In the example above, <code>file:etc/foo.n3</code> becomes
<code>file:DIR/foo.n3</code> because that is an exact match.  The prefix
match of </code>file:/etc/</code> is ignored.</p>

<p>All string tests are done case sensitively because the primary use
is for URLs.</p>


<p>Notes:
<ul>
<li>Property values are not URIs, but strings.  This is a system feature,
not an RDF feature. Prefix mapping is name rewriting;
alternate names are not treated as equivalent resources in the rest
of Jena. While application writers are encouraged to use URIs to identify
files, this is not always possible.</li>
<li>There is no check to see if the alternative system resource is
equivalent to the original.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>A LocationMapper finds its configuration file by looking for the
following files, in order:
<ul>
<li><code>file:etc/location-mapping.rdf</code></li>
<li><code>file:etc/location-mapping.n3</code></li>
<li><code>file:location-mapping.rdf</code></li>
<li><code>file:location-mapping.n3</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a specified as a path - note the path separator is always
the character ';' regardless of operating system because URLs contain ':'.
</p>

<p>Applications can also set mappings programmatically.  No configuration
file is necessary.</p>

<p>The base URI for reading models with the FileManager
will be the original URI, not the alternative location.</p>

<h3>Debugging</h3>

<p>Using log4j, set the logging level of the classes:
<pre class="box">
com.hp.hpl.jena.util.FileManager=ALL
com.hp.hpl.jena.util.LocationManager=ALL
</pre>

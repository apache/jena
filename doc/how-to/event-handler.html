<h2>ModelChangedListener</h2>
<p>
In Jena 2 it is possible to monitor a Model for changes,
so that code can be run after changes are applied without
the coding for that Model having to do anything special.
We call these changes "events". (They have nothing to do
with GUI events.)

<p>To monitor a Model, you must <i>register</i> a 
<i>ModelChangedListener</i> with that Model:

<pre>
    Model m = ModelFactory.createDefaultModel();
    ModelChangedListener L = new MyListener();
    m.register( L );
</pre>

<i>MyListener</i> must be an implementation of 
<i>ModelChangedListener</i>, for example:

<pre>
    class MyListener implements ModelChangedListener
        {
        public void addedStatement( Statement s ) 
            { System.out.println( ">> added statment " + s ); }
        public void addedStatements( Statement [] statements ) {}
        public void addedStatements( List statements ) {}
        public void addedStatements( StmtIterator statements ) {}
        public void addedStatements( Model m ) {}
        public void removedStatement( Statement s ) {}   
        public void removedStatements( Statement [] statements ) {}
        public void removedStatements( List statements ) {}
        public void removedStatements( StmtIterator statements ) {}
        public void removedStatements( Model m ) {}   
        }
</pre>

This listener ignores everything except the addition of single
statements to <i>m</i>; those it prints out. The listener has
a method for each of the ways that statements can be added to a Model:

<ul>
<li>as a single statement, Model::add(Statement)</li>
<li>as an element of an array of statements, Model::add(Statement[])</li>
<li>as an element of a list of statements, Model::add(List)</li>
<li>as an interator over statements, Model::add(StmtIterator)</li>
<li>as part of another Model, Model::add(Model)</li>
</ul>

<p>(Similarly for <i>delete</i>.)
</p>

<p>
The listener method is called when the statement(s) have been added to
the Model, if no exceptions have been thrown. It does not matter if the
statement was <i>already</i> in the Model or not; it is the act of
adding it that fires the listener. 

<p> 
There is no guarantee that the statement, array, list, or model that
is added or removed is the same one that is passed to the appropriate
listener method, and the <i>StmtIterator</i> will never be the same
one. However,

<ul>
<li>a single Statement will be .equals to the original Statement</li>
<li>a List will be .equals to the original List</li>
<li>a Statement[] will be the same length and have .equal elements
     in the same order
     </li>
<li>a StmtIterator will deliver .equal elements in the same order</li>
<li>a Model will contain the same statements</li>
</ul>

<p>
Further, there is no guarantee that <i>only</i> Statements etc added
through the Model API will be presented to the listener; anything added
to its underlying Graph will also be presented to the listener.

<h2>Utility classes</h2>

The full Listener API is rather chunky and it can be inconvenient to
use, especially for the creation of inline classes. There are four
utility classes in <i>com.hp.hpl.jena.rdf.listeners:</i>

<ul>
<li>NullListener. This class implements ModelChangedListener and
all its methods do nothing. This is useful when you want to intercept
only certain ways of updating a Model.
</li>
<li>ChangedListener. This class implements ModelChangedListener and
records only whether some change has been made since the last inquiry
using the method <i>hasChanged()</i>.
</li>
<li>StatementListener. This class translates all bulk update calls
(ie the ones other than addedStatement() and removedStatement()) into
a call to addedStatement()/removedStatement() for each Statement in the
collection. This allows statements to be tracked whether they are added
one at a time or in bulk.
</li>
<li>ObjectListener. This class translates all the listener calls into
<i>added(Object)</i> or <i>removed(Object)</i> as appropriate; it
is left to the user code to distinguish among the types of argument.
</li>
</ul>

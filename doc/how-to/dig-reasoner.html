<p>
  The built-in Jena rule-based reasoners are able to provide semantic entailments for ontologies using
  OWL-lite, and some constructs from OWL-DL and OWL-full.  However, for large or complex ontologies 
  the rule-based approach is computationally very expensive.  Moreover, there are useful modelling primitives
  in OWL-DL that many semantic-web applications will wish to make use of.  Jena's architecture provides
  a mechanism for attaching external reasoners to Jena models, by re-implementing the Graph interface.
  Jena version 2.1 onwards provides an illustration of this technique by providing a transparent 
  gateway between Jena ontology models and external reasoners implementing the DIG description
  logic reasoner interface (henceforth abbreviated simply to the <em>DIG interface</em>).
</p>
<p>
  The DIG interface is an emerging standard for providing access to description-logic reasoning
  via an HTTP-based interface to a separate reasoning process. Available DIG reasoners 
  at the time of writing include:
  <a href="http://www.cs.concordia.ca/~haarslev/racer/">Racer</a>,
  <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~horrocks/FaCT/">FaCT</a> and
  <a href="http://www.mindswap.org/2003/pellet/index.shtml">Pellet</a>.
  In principle, Jena should work with any conformant DIG reasoner (but see note below).  The current
  release has only been tested with Racer, version 1.7.19.  Note that earlier versions of Racer
  <strong>will not work</strong> with the Jena DIG adapter, as a number of bugs in Racer's DIG
  implementation were fixed during the development process.
</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
  Figure 1 shows an overview of the connection between a Jena ontology model and an existing DIG reasoner
  process.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="../images/digSchematic.png" alt="schematic diagram" />
  <br />
  <span class="centered"><strong>Figure 1: Schematic of dataflows between Jena model and DIG reasoner</strong></span>
</p>
<p>
  Two things should be clear from Figure 1. The first is that accessing a DIG reasoner in Jena is
  identical to accessing a normal model.  That is, the normal model API is used to, for example, 
  list the classes in the model or determine the properties of an individual. Moreover, the information
  inferred by the reasoner is available as RDF triples.  So, if the reasoner determines that a class
  <code>A</code> is unsatisfiable, the triple <code>:A&nbsp;rdfs:subClassOf&nbsp;owl:Nothing</code>
  will appear in the model.  The second thing that Figure 1 shows is that the DIG adapter must
  be told the host name and port number for accessing the HTTP interface of the reasoner.
</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setting up a Jena DIG reasoner</h2>
<p>
  In Jena, a <em>reasoner</em> is an object that creates instances of an inference graph
  (<a href="../javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/reasoner/InfGraph.html"><code>InfGraph</code></a>) 
  that is able to produce additional triples based on the triples
  asserted in the base graph.  This is shown in Figure 1: the base graph is maintained on the
  Jena side (i.e. client-side); when a triple is added to a model backed by a DIG reasoner 
  it is first asserted into the base graph. This allows Jena programs access to the raw data, 
  as well as  the inferred data. For example, it is typically only the contents of the base graph that is 
  written out when the model is serialized.
</p>
<p>
  To create a <a href="../javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/reasoner/dig/DIGReasoner.html"><code>DIGReasoner</code></a> 
  object that can bind a base graph to an external reasoner,
  we invoke the <a href="../javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/reasoner/dig/DIGReasonerFactory.html"><code>DIGReasonerFactory</code></a>.  The full syntax for doing this is:
</p>
<pre>
   DIGReasonerFactory drf = (DIGReasonerFactory) ReasonerRegistry.theRegistry()
                                                                 .getFactory( DIGReasonerFactory.URI );
   DIGReasoner r = (DIGReasoner) drf.create( null );</pre>
<p>
  Since this is quite verbose, a short-cut exists:
</p>
<pre>
   DIGReasoner r = (DIGReasoner) ReasonerRegistry.theRegistry().create( DIGReasonerFactory.URI, null );</pre>
<p>
  However, note that there are circumstances when the longer form is required (see below). 
  The <code>null</code> parameter passed to the <code>create</code> call is an optional
  configuration 
    <a href="../javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/rdf/model/Resource.html"><code>Resource</code></a>. 
  To pass configuration parameters to the reasoner, such
  as a non-default host or port address for connecting to the reasoner, properties are attached
  to a resource and passed in to the <code>create</code> call.
</p>
<p>
  Note that a DIG reasoner does not necessarily have built-in knowledge of the common semantic-web
  ontology languages (such as OWL and DAML+OIL).  The DIG encoding language is neutral to such
  specific encodings.  This presents a problem when working with OWL and DAML, as some facts are
  assumed to be common knowledge (for example the fact that <code>owl:TransitiveProperty</code>
  is an <code>owl:ObjectProperty</code>).  The Jena rule reasoner handles this requirement by 
  defining specific rules for the common-knowledge language axioms.  This is not an option for 
  the Jena DIG reasoner (a model that relied on both internal and external reasoners would be
  complex indeed!). Instead, we provide an option to create a DIG reasoner with a specific set
  of axioms built-in to the model.  These are provided by variants to the <code>create()</code>
  call: 
  <code>createWithDAMLAxioms(Resource&nbsp;configuration)</code>
  <code>createWithOWLAxioms(Resource&nbsp;configuration)</code>. Thus, to create a DIG reasoner
  specialised for OWL usage, with configuration parameters attached to the resource
  <code>config</code> we would use:
</p>
<pre>
   DIGReasonerFactory drf = (DIGReasonerFactory) ReasonerRegistry.theRegistry()
                                                                 .getFactory( DIGReasonerFactory.URI );
   DIGReasoner r = (DIGReasoner) drf.createWithOWLAxioms( config );</pre>
<p>
   It may be noted that creating a reasoner with pre-loaded axioms in this way precludes the
   use of the short-cut form.
</p>

<h2 id="model">Attaching a DIG reasoner to an ontology model</h2>
<p>
  A Jena OntModel provides a convenience API for working with semantic web ontology sources.
  To bind an OntModel to the DIG reasoner, we create an ontology model spec that includes
  the DIG reasoner created above. A typical pattern (assuming reasoner <code>r</code> has
  already been created, see above) is:
</p>
<pre>
  OntModelSpec spec = new OntModelSpec( OntModelSpec.OWL_DL_MEM );
  spec.setReasoner( r );
  OntModel m = ModelFactory.createOntologyModel( spec, null );</pre>
<p>
  Ontology model <code>m</code> can then be used in the normal way.  If a large model is to be
  prepared, it may sometimes be more efficient to create the model first, with no reasoner, then
  bind that model to the reasoner to create the inference model. A typical pattern is:
</p>
<pre>
  OntModel base = ModelFactory.createOntologyModel( OntModelSpec.OWL_DL_MEM, null );
  // ... build or load the model contents ...
  
  OntModelSpec spec = new OntModelSpec( OntModelSpec.OWL_DL_MEM );
  spec.setReasoner( r );
  
  OntModel m = ModelFactory.createOntologyModel( spec, base );</pre>

<h2 id="config">Configuring the DIG reasoner interface</h2>
<p>
  The DIG reasoner can be configured by passing configuration properties attached 
  to a config resource when invoking <code>create()</code> on the reasoner factory.
  The following table shows the configuration parameters recognised by the DIG reasoner.
  Note that the prefix <code>rConf:</code> is defined as 
  <code>http://jena.hpl.hp.com/2003/JenaReasoner#</code>, and that vocabulary constants
  are available from the 
    <a href="../javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/vocabulary/ReasonerVocabulary.html"><code>ReasonerVocabulary</code></a> 
  class in Java.
</p>
<table width="700" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" border="1">
  <tr><th style="width:150">URI</th><th style="width:150">Vocabulary constant</th><th style="width:400">Meaning</th></tr>
  <tr><td><code>rConf:extReasonerURL</code></td>
    <td><code>EXT_REASONER_URL</code></td>
    <td>Specifies the URL of the connection to the reasoner. Only the hostname and port
      are used.  Default value is <code>http://localhost:8081</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td><code>rConf: extReasonerOntologyLang</code></td>
    <td><code>EXT_REASONER_ONT_LANG</code></td>
    <td>A URI that specifies the ontology language (OWL or DAML) that will be used with the reasoner.
      The URI constants are available from the <code>ProfileRegistry</code>.  Default is OWL.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td><code>rConf:extReasonerAxioms</code></td>
    <td><code>EXT_REASONER_AXIOMS</code></td>
    <td>Specifies a URL for a set of axioms to load into the reasoner to support the ontology
      language being used.  Default value is none.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2 id="example">Extended example</h2>
<p>
  The following program shows a complete example of using the DIG reasoner, with a non-default
  URL to connect to.  We assume that the DIG reasoner has been started on port 2004 (e.g.
  with <code>racer&nbsp;-http&nbsp;2004</code>).
</p>
<pre>
import com.hp.hpl.jena.ontology.*;
import com.hp.hpl.jena.rdf.model.*;
import com.hp.hpl.jena.reasoner.ReasonerRegistry;
import com.hp.hpl.jena.reasoner.dig.*;
import com.hp.hpl.jena.vocabulary.*;


public class DIGExample
{
  public static void main( String[] args ) {
    // set up a configuration resource to connect to the reasoner
    // on port 2004 on the local system
    Model cModel = ModelFactory.createDefaultModel();
    Resource conf = cModel.createResource();
    conf.addProperty( ReasonerVocabulary.EXT_REASONER_URL, 
                      cModel.createResource( "http://localhost:2004" ) );
       
    // create the reasoner factory and the reasoner
    DIGReasonerFactory drf = (DIGReasonerFactory) ReasonerRegistry.theRegistry()
                                                                  .getFactory( DIGReasonerFactory.URI );
    DIGReasoner r = (DIGReasoner) drf.create( conf );
        
    // now make a model
    OntModelSpec spec = new OntModelSpec( OntModelSpec.OWL_DL_MEM );
    spec.setReasoner( r );
    OntModel m = ModelFactory.createOntologyModel( spec, null );
        
    // load an input document
    m.read( "http://protege.stanford.edu/plugins/owl/owl-library/koala.owl" );
        
    // list the inconsistent classes
    StmtIterator i = m.listStatements( null, OWL.equivalentClass, OWL.Nothing );
    while (i.hasNext()) {
        System.out.println( "Class " + i.nextStatement().getSubject() + " is unsatisfiable" );
    }
  }
}</pre>
<p>
  The output produced by this program was:
</p>
<pre>Class http://protege.stanford.edu/plugins/owl/owl-library/koala.owl#KoalaWithPhD is unsatisfiable
Class 2d9c06:fca384780f:-7ff4 is unsatisfiable
Class http://protege.stanford.edu/plugins/owl/owl-library/koala.owl#Koala is unsatisfiable
Class http://protege.stanford.edu/plugins/owl/owl-library/koala.owl#Quokka is unsatisfiable</pre>
<p>
  The second value is Jena's anonymous node (bNode) identifier for a class expression from
  the input document that intersects with Koala, which is itself unsatisfiable.
</p>

<h2 id="cautions">Caveats and cautions</h2>
<p>
  The DIG interface should be regarded as experimental for the time being. The most extensive 
  testing has been performed with OWL as the input language and Racer as the reasoning engine.
  Other reasoners, or the use of DAML+OIL as the input language, are provided for in the
  code but not well tested yet.  Users are encouraged to report problems and suggestions to 
  the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jena-dev/">Jena support list</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Note also that DIG itself is an immature standard.  Some parts of OWL-DL cannot be expressed
  in the DIG tell language, and some desirable queries are not possible.  An ongoing discussion
  about improving DIG is continuing on the DIG-users list, hosted by 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dig">SourceForge</a>.

<h2>Answers</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<p id="general-0"><strong>Q: Why do I get a ClassNotFoundException when I run Jena?</strong><br>
  A: This means that one or more of the libraries that Jena depends on is not
  on your classpath. Typically, all of the librarys (.jar files) in $JENA/lib,
  where $JENA refers to the directory in which you installed Jena, should be on
  your classpath. Consult the documentation for your JDK for details on setting
  the classpath for your system.</p>
  
<h3>RDF model API</h3>
    <p id="api-0"><strong>Q. Why does the localname part of my URI look wrong?</strong><br />
      A: In Jena it is possible to retrieve the localname part of a Resource or Property 
      URI. Sometimes developers create Resources with a full URI reference but 
      find that the result of a getLocalName call is not quite what they expected. 
      This is usually because the URI is ill-formed or cannot be correctly split 
      in the way you expected. The only reason for separating namespace and local 
      name is to support the XML serialization in which qnames are used for properties 
      and classes. Thus the main requirement of the split is that the localname 
      component must be a legal XML NCName. This means it must start with a letter 
      or _ character and can only contain limited punctuation. In particular, 
      they can't contain spaces, but then spaces are not legal in URI references 
      anyway. In general, it is best to not use the localname split to encode 
      any information, you should only be concerned with it if you are coding 
      a parser or writer.</p>
      
<h3>Reasoner and inference models</h3>
  <p id="reasoner-0"><strong>Q. I want to develop my own rules, how do I get started?</strong><br />
    A: The GenericRuleReasoner is the place to start. You can create instances of this reasoner by
    supplying either an explict set of Rule objects or a configuration description (as a Jena Model)
    that points to a local rule file. See the inference documentation for more details: <br />
    <a href="inference/index.html#rules">inference/index.html#rules</a>
  </p>

  <p id="reasoner-1"><strong>Q. Why are there two different arrows ( -&gt; and &lt;- ) in the rule syntax?</strong><br />
    A: As explained in the documentation there are two rule systems available - a 
    forward chainer and a backward chainer. You can chose to use either or 
    use the two together in a hybrid mode. <br />

    So if we use Ti as short hand for triple patterns like (?x rdf:type ?C), 
    and if we ignore functors and procedural call out for now, then the syntax:<br />
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    T1, T2, ... TN -> T0 .    </code> <br />
    means that if the triple patterns T1 to TN match in the data set then 
    then the triple T0 can be deduced as a consequence. Similarly <br />
    <code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   T0 <- T1, T2, ... TN .    </code> <br />
    means the same thing - the consequence is always on the "pointy" end of 
    the arrow. <br />

    Now if you are just using pure forward or backward rules then you could 
    chose to use either syntax interchangeably. This allows you to write a 
    rule set and use it in either mode. Though in practice "-&gt;" is the more 
    conventional direction in forward systems and "&lt;-" is the more 
    conventional one in backward systems. <br />

    The hybrid configuration allows you to create new backward rules as a 
    result of forward rules firing so that the syntax: <br />
    <code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    T1, T2 -> [T0 <- T3, T4] .     </code> <br />
    Is saying that if both T1 and T2 match in the dataset then add the 
    backward rule "[T0 &lt;- T3, T4]" after instantiating any bound variables.
  </p>

<h3>Ontology API</h3>
<p id="ontology-0"><strong>Q: Why doesn't <code>listClasses()</code> (or <code>listProperties()</code>/<code>listIndividuals()</code>,
  etc) work?</strong><br />
  A: It does work. Extensive unit tests are used to check the correctness of Jena,
  and are included in the downloaded source code for your reference. If <code>listClasses()</code>,
  or a similar method, is not producing the answers you expect, or no answers
  at all, you should first check that your model is correctly defined. Print a
  copy of your model as a debug step, to see if the URI's match up (e.g, if you
  are expecting resource x to be an individual of class Y, check that the rdf:type
  of x is the same as the URI of the class declaration for Y). A common problem
  is that relative URI's change depending where you read the model from. Try adding
  an <code>xml:base</code> declaration to the document to ensure that URI's are
  correctly specified.</p>
  
<p id="ontology-1"><strong>Q: Why doesn't the ontlogy API handle <code>sub-class</code> 
	(or <code>sub-property</code>, <code>domain</code>, <code>range</code>, etc) 
  	relationships in a DAML model?</strong><br />
  	A: These relationships are handled correctly, but the results you see are dependent on the
  	model configuration.  The DAML specification includes a number of aliases for RDFS constructs to
  	copy them into the DAML+OIL namespace. This means that, for a DAML processor, <code>daml:subClassOf</code>
  	and <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> are equivalent.  This is declared by means of a 
  	<code>daml:samePropertyAs</code> in the daml+oil.daml specification document.  Without a reasoner
  	attached to the model, the ontology API will not recognise the equivalence with <code>rdfs:</code> properties.
  	Thus, if you are not seeing the expected results when processing a DAML ontology, 
  	it is likely that your ontology file contains, for example, <br />
  	<code>&lt;daml:Class rdf:ID="A"&gt; &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="B" /&gt; ...</code> <br />
  	To fix this, either ensure that the ontology consistently uses <code>daml:</code> relationships,
  	or declare the ontology model with the DAML micro rule-reasoner: <br />
  	<code>OntModel m = ModelFactory.createOntologyModel( OntModelSpec.DAML_MEM_RULE_INF, null );</code>
	</p>
<h3>Database and persistence</h3>
<p id="db-0"><strong>Q: Why do I get an exception when trying to create a new persistent model?</strong><br>
  A: Assuming that your program uses correct methods to create the model (see 
examples in the database <a href="../DB/howto.html">howto</a>), it may be that 
your database files are corrupted. Jena2 does <i>not</i> do a good job in 
checking the validity of the database. It makes a cursory check that some 
required tables exist but does not check that the tables contain valid data. If 
you suspect your database has been corrupted, you may invoke
<code>cleanDB()</code> on a DBConnection object 
prior to creating your model. This removes all Jena2 tables from a database. 
Warning: this removes any other existing Jena2 models from the database so make sure 
that this is what you want to do. </p>
  <p id="db-1"><strong>Q: Why do I run out of memory when trying to list statements in a persistent 
  model?</strong><br>
  A: Jena2 uses the JDBC interface for accessing databases. The JDBC 
  specification has no cursors. Consequently, when a query is processed by JDBC, 
  the entire result set is returned from the database at once and the application program then iterates 
  over the in-memory result set. If the result set is large, as is often the case 
  when listing all statements of a large model, it may exceed the heap size of 
  the Java virtual machine. If you suspect this is happening, you might try to 
  increase the heap size of the Java virtual machine (<code>-vmargs 
  -Xmx500M</code> for a 500 MB heap size). If this does not help, there is no 
  other work-around and the program should be recoded.</p>
<p id="db-2"><strong>Q: Has Jena2 persistence been ported to other database engines and platforms 
  besides those officially supported?</strong><br>
  A: The Jena team  supports Jena2 persistence on the databases and operating 
systems listed in the <a href="../DB/index.html">Database Interface Release 
Notes</a>. 
Other users have had success porting Jena2 to other databases and platforms. 
Jena2 has been ported to IBM's DB2 database. Contact
<a href="mailto:zhabglj@us.ibm.com">Liang-Jie Zhang</a> for details. A port to 
HSQLDB, a native-Java SQL database, has been done. Contact
<a href="mailto:danils@home.se">Jan Danils</a> for details. On the Mac OS X 
platform, Jena2 has been successfully run using MySQL. Contact
<a href="mailto:jnachlin@nachlin.com">Jim Nachlin</a> for details.</p>

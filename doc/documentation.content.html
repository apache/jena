<h2>Minimal Documentation</h2>

<p>
Unfortunately this version of the IRI Library has 
badly incomplete documentation, any help in producing
good documentation would be appreciated.
</p>

<p>
The current version is incomplete with little indication
as to where.
It is primarily intended to support the functionality
of checking strings against any of the various IRI or
URI specifications. Some support for different
levels of checking is provided.
</p>

<p>
These instructions are from a mail message on the jena-dev
mailing list.

Summary:
=======
use something like:

import com.hp.hpl.jena.iri.*;

 static IRIFactory iriFactory = IRIFactory
                                .semanticWebImplementation();

...

   boolean includeWarnings = false;
   IRI iri;
   iri = iriFactory.create{iriString); // always works
   if (iri.hasViolation(includeWarnings)) {
     // bad iri code
   }

...

Since you are taking IRI rules seriously, you may want to have 
includeWarnings = true in the above.

Full version
============
The code is found in the iri.jar, which is not particularly 
well documented, and the source and documentation is in the 
separate iri download, from the Jena download area.

As shown, you start by building an IRIFactory

com.hp.hpl.jena.iri.IRIFactory

this embodies some set of rules, against which you will check 
an IRI.

The one we use is:
  IRIFactory.jenaImplementation()
    For use by Jena team only.
    This method reflects the current IRI support
    in Jena, which is a moving target at present.

(actually it hasn't ever moved - the main issue is to do with 
file: IRIs - we definitely want to be more liberal than a 
conservative reading of the specs allow, because, e.g. 
filenames with spaces in happen, and because file uris like 
file:localFile which aren't particularly conformant, also 
happen).

others, that allow you to control which specs you are checking 
against are:

  IRIFactory.iriImplementation()   RFC 3987
  IRIFactory.uriImplementation()   RFC 3986 (US-ASCII only)

  IRIFactory.semanticWebImplementation()
       This factory is a conservative implementation
       appropriate for Semantic Web applications.

Having got your factory then you convert a string into an IRI 
in one of two ways, depending on how you want to handle errors:

e.g.
   IRI iri;
   try {
     iri = iriFactory.construct{iriString);
   }
   catch (IRIException e) {
     // bad iri code

   }


or

   boolean includeWarnings = false;
   IRI iri;
   iri = iriFactory.create{iriString); // always works
   if (iri.hasViolation(includeWarnings)) {
     // bad iri code
// e.g.

        Iterator it = iri.violations(includeWarnings);
        while (it.hasNext()) {
            Violation v = (Violation) it.next();
   // do something:    printErrorMessages(v);

        }
   }

various warning and error conditions are listed in the java doc 
for ViolationCodes (in the iri download).
An error is a MUST force statement from the spec, 
a warning corresponds to a SHOULD force statement from the 
spec. There is also some support for 'minting' violations,
which provide a stricter level of checking for
IRIs that you are generating, as opposed to IRIs
that have been passed to your application from elsewhere.

So that, if I remember correctly:

http://example.org:80/foo

raises a warning with code DEFAULT_PORT_SHOULD_BE_OMITTED

Like this one, many of the SHOULD force statements help avoid having 
two different IRIs that have the same operational semantics.

Each spec is implemented as some set of active error and warning 
codes, so depending on which factory you chose in the first place, 
you may get a different collection of spec violations, some with 
SHOULD force and some with MUST force.

There are also potentially warnings associated with security issues 
like IRI spoofing, which may not strictly violate any SHOULDs 
in any spec.

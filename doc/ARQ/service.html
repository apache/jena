<h1>ARQ - Basic Federated SPARQL Query</h1>

			<p>There are already ways to access remote RDF data. The simplest is 
			to read a document which is an RDF graph and query it. Another way 
			is with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-protocol/">
			SPARQL protocol</a> which allows a query to be sent to a remote 
			service endpoint and the results sent back (in RDF, or an
			<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-XMLres/">XML-based results 
			format</a> or even a
			<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-json-res/">JSON one</a>).</p>
<p>The SERVICE extension adds the ability to make SPARQL protocol calls within a 
query, not just send the whole query to the remote service.</p>
			<h2>Syntax</h2>
			<p>A new keyword <code>SERVICE</code> is added to the extended 
			SPARQL query language in ARQ. 
			This keyword causes the sub-pattern to be sent to a named SPARQL 
			service endpoint, and not matched against a local graph.</p>
			<pre class="box">PREFIX : &lt;http://example/&gt;
PREFIX  dc:     &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt;

SELECT ?a
FROM &lt;mybooks.rdf&gt;
{
  ?b dc:title ?title .
  <b>SERVICE</b> &lt;http://sparql.org/books&gt;
     { ?s dc:title ?title . ?s dc:creator ?a }
}</pre>
			<h2>Algebra</h2>
			<p>There is a new operator in the algebra.</p>
			<pre class="box">(prefix ((dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt;))
  (project (?a)
    (join
      (BGP [triple ?b dc:title ?title])
      (<b>service</b> &lt;http://sparql.org/books&gt;
          (BGP
            [triple ?s dc:title ?title]
            [triple ?s dc:creator ?a]
          ))
      )))</pre>
			<h2>Performance Considerations</h2>
			<p>This feature is a basic building block to allow remote access in 
			the middle of a query, not a general solution to the issues in 
			distributed query evaluation. The algebra operation is executed 
			without regard to how selective the pattern is. So the order of the 
			query will affect the speed of execution. Because it involves HTTP 
			operations, asking the query in the right order matters a lot. Don't 
			ask for the whole of a bookstore just to find book whose title comes 
			from a local RDF file - ask the bookshop a query with the title 
			already bound from earlier in the query.</p>

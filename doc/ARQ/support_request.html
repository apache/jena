<h1>Writing a Support Request</h1>

<p>A good support request or bug report is clear and concise.  For ARQ, reduce the problem 
to a short dataset (20 triples should be enough; Turtle, N3 or N-triples preferred)
and a query that illustrates the problem.   State what you expected to happen as well as what
did happen.
</p>

<p>It also a good idea to check the documentation.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Parse Errors</h3>

<p>The SPARQL parser outputs a line and column number - it is usually
correct in identifying the first point of a syntax error.</p>

<h3>Execution failure</h3>

<p>If you are reporting a failure that produces a stack trace, please
include the message, exception and the stack trace.  Only if it is very
long, should you truncate the trace but please include the whole trace to
the point where it indicates it is entering ARQ (a package name starting 
<code>com.hp.hpl.jena.query</code>) and then one level which is your code.</p>

<h3>Unexpected results</h3>

<p>If you are getting unexpected results, show the results you expect
as well as what you actually get.</p>
<p>If you are getting no results, or less than you expected, try cutting parts 
out of the query until something chnages.</p>

<p>
There are various formatters for result sets included in ARQ.&nbsp; Print your 
results in text form if possible.
There is a
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/tests/README.html">testing format</a>
used by the Data Access Working Group and
that is used for the scripted tests in the distribution.
</p>


<h3>Reports</h3>
<p>A bug report or support request should be <b>complete</b> and <b>minimal</b>. 
It helps you to develop a concise description of the problem - often, you will 
discover the solution yourself.</p>
<p><i>Complete</i> means that any query included should include prefixes and the 
whole syntax string, not a fragment.&nbsp; Any program code should be ready to 
run, not a fragment of a large program.</p>
<p><i>Minimal</i> means that the data sent should be an abbreviated selection to 
illustrate the point. </p>
<p>Typically, any program will be less that 20 lines, and any data less than 20 
triples.</p>

<p>The report should also include details of the execution environment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Environment:
  <ul>
    <li>ARQ version</li>
    <li>Java version</li>
    <li>Operating system</li>
    <li>What's the CLASSPATH?</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How are you running the query?
  <ul>
    <li>Are you running in an application server?  Which one?</li>
    <li>Have you used the command line tools?</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Data:
  <ul>
    <li>Does your data parse as RDF?</li>
    <li>Are you querying an inference model?</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Query:
  <ul>
    <li>Have you printed out the query exactly as it is (especially
    if the string has been assembled in by java code)? It is a good idea to print
    the query out after building it programmatically.</li>
    <li>Have you passed the query through the <a href="cmds.html#arq.qparse">SPARQL syntax checker</a>?<br/>
        <code>java -cp ... arq.qparse 'your query'</code>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Bug reports should be sent to the
<a href="mailto:jena-dev@groups.yahoo.com?s=ARQ">jena-dev mailing list</a> (you 
need to subscribe to send to this list).</p>

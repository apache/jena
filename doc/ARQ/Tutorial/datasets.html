  <h1>SPARQL Tutorial - Datasets</h1>

  <p>This section covers RDF Datasets - an RDF Dataset is the unit that
  is queried by a SPARQL query.  It consists of a default graph, and a
  number of named graphs.
  </p>

  <h2>Querying datasets</h2>

  <p>The graph matching operation
  (<a href="basic_patterns.html">basic patterns</a>, <a href="optionals.html">
  <code>OPTIONAL</code>s</a>, and <a href="union.html"><code>UNION</code>s</a>) 
  work on one RDF graph.&nbsp; This starts out being the default graph of the 
  dataset but it can be changed by the <code>GRAPH</code> keyword.

  <pre class="box">GRAPH <i>uri</i> { ... pattern ... }</pre>
  <pre class="box">GRAPH <i>var</i> { ... pattern ... }</pre>
  <p>If a URI is given, the pattern will be matched against the graph in the 
  dataset with that name - if there isn't one, the <code>GRAPH</code> clause 
  fails to match at all.</p>
  <p>If a variable is given, all the named graphs (not the default graph) are 
  tried.&nbsp; The variable may be used elsewhere so that if, during execution, 
  it's value is already known for a solution, only the specific named graph 
  is tried. The variable may be a blank node which is useful when the 
  application does not care as to which named graph is matched, only that all of 
  them are tried.</p>
  <pre class="box">GRAPH <span style="background-position: 0 0">[]</span> { ... pattern ... }</pre>
  <h3>Example Data</h3>
  <p>An RDF dataset can take a variety of forms.&nbsp; Two common setups are to 
  have the default graph being the union (the RDF merge) of all the named graphs 
  and to have the default graph be an inventory of the named graphs (where they came 
  from, when they were read etc).&nbsp; There are no limitations - one graph can be 
  included twice under different names, or some graphs may share triples with 
  others.</p>
  <p>In the examples below we will use the following dataset that might occur 
  for an RDF aggregator of book details:</p>
  <p>Default graph (<a href="ds-dft.ttl">ds-dft.ttl</a>):</p>
  <pre class="box">@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt; .
@prefix xsd: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt; .

&lt;ds-ng-1.ttl&gt; dc:date &quot;2005-07-14T03:18:56+0100&quot;^^xsd:dateTime .
&lt;ds-ng-2.ttl&gt; dc:date &quot;2005-09-22T05:53:05+0100&quot;^^xsd:dateTime .
</pre>
  <p>Named graph (<a href="ds-ng-1.ttl">ds-ng-1.ttl</a>):</p>
  <pre class="box">@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt; .

[] dc:title &quot;Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone&quot; .
[] dc:title &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; .</pre>
  <p>Named graph (<a href="ds-ng-2.ttl">ds-ng-2.ttl</a>):</p>
  <pre class="box">@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt; .

[] dc:title &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; . 
[] dc:title &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; .
</pre>
  <p>That is, we have two small graphs describing some books, and we have a 
  default graph which records when these graphs were last read </p>
  <p>Queries can be run with the command line application (this would be all one 
  line):</p>
  <pre class="box">java -cp ... arq.sparql
    --graph ds-dft.ttl --namedgraph ds-ng-1.ttl --namedgraph ds-ng-2.ttl
    --query <i>query file</i></pre>
  <p>Datasets don't have to created just for the lifetime of the query.&nbsp; 
  They can be created and stored in a database, as would be more usual for an 
  aggregator application.</p>
  <h3>Accessing the Dataset</h3>
  <p>The first example just accesses the default graph (<a href="q-ds-1.rq">q-ds-1.rq</a>):</p>
  <pre class="box">PREFIX xsd: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt;
PREFIX dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt;
PREFIX : &lt;.&gt;

SELECT *
{ ?s ?p ?o }</pre>
  <p>(The &quot;<code>PREFIX : &lt;.&gt;</code>&quot;&nbsp; just helps format the output)</p>
  <pre class="box">----------------------------------------------------------------------
| s            | p       | o                                         |
======================================================================
| :ds-ng-2.ttl | dc:date | "2005-09-22T05:53:05+01:00"^^xsd:dateTime |
| :ds-ng-1.ttl | dc:date | "2005-07-14T03:18:56+01:00"^^xsd:dateTime |
----------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>
  <p>This is the default graph only - nothing from the named graphs because they 
  aren't queried unless explicitly indicated via <code>GRAPH</code>.</p>
  <p>We can query for all triples by querying the default graph and the named 
  graphs (<a href="q-ds-2.rq">q-ds-2.rq</a>):</p>
  <pre class="box">PREFIX  xsd:    &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt;
PREFIX  dc:     &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt;
PREFIX  :       &lt;.&gt;

SELECT *
{ 
    { ?s ?p ?o } UNION { GRAPH ?g { ?s ?p ?o } } 
}</pre>
  <p>giving:</p>
  <pre class="box">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| s            | p        | o                                          | g            |
=======================================================================================
| :ds-ng-2.ttl | dc:date  | "2005-09-22T05:53:05+01:00"^^xsd:dateTime  |              |
| :ds-ng-1.ttl | dc:date  | "2005-07-14T03:18:56+01:00"^^xsd:dateTime  |              |
| _:b0         | dc:title | "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"    | :ds-ng-2.ttl |
| _:b1         | dc:title | "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"  | :ds-ng-2.ttl |
| _:b2         | dc:title | "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"  | :ds-ng-1.ttl |
| _:b3         | dc:title | "Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone"  | :ds-ng-1.ttl |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>
  <h3>Querying a specific graph</h3>

  <p>If the application knows the name graph, it can directly ask a query such 
  as finding all the titles in a given graph (<a href="q-ds-3.rq">q-ds-3.rq</a>):</p>
  <pre class="box">PREFIX dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt;
PREFIX : &lt;.&gt;

SELECT ?title
{ 
  GRAPH :ds-ng-2.ttl
    { ?b dc:title ?title }
}
</pre>
  <p>Results:</p>
  <pre class="box">---------------------------------------------
| title                                     |
=============================================
| &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot;   |
| &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; |
---------------------------------------------</pre>
  <h3>Querying to find data from graphs that match a pattern</h3>

  <p>The name of the graphs to be queried can be determined with the query 
  itself. The same process for variables applies whether they are part of a 
  graph pattern or the <code>GRAPH</code> form. The query below (<a href="q-ds-4.rq">q-ds-4.rq</a>) 
  sets a condition on the variable used to select named graphs, based on 
  information in the default graph.</p>
  <pre class="box">PREFIX  xsd:    &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt;
PREFIX  dc:     &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt;
PREFIX  :       &lt;.&gt;

SELECT ?date ?title
{ 
  ?g dc:date ?date . FILTER (?date &gt; "2005-08-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime )
  GRAPH ?g 
      { ?b dc:title ?title }
}</pre>
  <p>The results of executing this query on the example dataset are the titles 
  in one of the graphs, the one with the date later than 1 August 2005.</p>
  <pre class="box">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| date                                      | title                                     |
=========================================================================================
| &quot;2005-09-22T05:53:05+01:00&quot;^^xsd:dateTime | &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot;   |
| &quot;2005-09-22T05:53:05+01:00&quot;^^xsd:dateTime | &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>
  <h2>Describing RDF Datasets - <code>FROM</code> and <code>FROM NAMED</code></h2>
  <p>A query execution can be given the dataset when the execution
  object is built or it can be described in the query itself.

  When the details are on the command line, a temporary dataset is created but 
  an application can create datasets and then use them in many queries.</p>
  <p>When described in the query, <code>FROM <i>url</i></code> is used to identify the contents
  to be in the default graph.  There can be more than one
  <code>FROM</code> clause
  and the default graph is result of reading each file into the default
  graph.  It is the RDF merge of the individual graphs.</p>
  <p>Don't be confused by the fact the default graph is described by one
  or more URLs in <code>FROM</code> clauses.  This is where the data is
  read from, not the name of the graph.  As several FROM clauses can be
  given, the data can be read in from several places but none of them
  become the graph name.</p>

  <p><code>FROM NAMED <i>url</i></code> is used to identify a named
  graph.  The graph is given the name <i>url</i> and the data is read
  from that location. Multiple <code>FROM NAMED</code> clauses cause multiple graphs 
  to be added to the dataset.</p>

  <p>Note that graphs are loaded with the Jena FileManager which includes
  the ability to provide alternative locations for files. For example,
  the query may have <code>FROM NAMED &lt;http://example/data&gt;</code>,
  and the data actually be read from <code>file:local.rdf</code>.  The
  name of the graph will be &lt;http://example/data&gt; as in the query.
  </p>

  <p>For example, the query to find all the triples in both default graph and 
  named graphs could be written as (<a href="q-ds-5.rq">q-ds-5.rq</a>):</p>
  <pre class="box">PREFIX xsd: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt;
PREFIX dc:  &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt;
PREFIX :    &lt;.&gt;

SELECT *
FROM       &lt;ds-dft.ttl&gt;
FROM NAMED &lt;ds-ng-1.ttl&gt;
FROM NAMED &lt;ds-ng-2.ttl&gt;
{ 
   { ?s ?p ?o } UNION { GRAPH ?g { ?s ?p ?o } } 
}</pre>

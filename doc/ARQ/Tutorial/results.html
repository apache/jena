  <h1>Producing Result Sets</h1>

  <p>SPARQL has 4 result forms:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SELECT &ndash; Return a table of results.</li>
    <li>CONSTRUCT &ndash; Return an RDF graph, based on a template in the query.</li>
    <li>DESCRIBE &ndash; Return an RDF graph, based on what the query processor 
    is configured to return.</li>
    <li>ASK &ndash; Ask a boolean query.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The SELECT form directly returns a table of solutions as a result set, 
  while DESCRIBE and CONSTRUCT use the outcome of matching to build RDF graphs.</p>

  <h2>Solution Modifiers</h2>
  <p>Pattern matching produces a set of solutions. This set can be modified in 
  various ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Projection - keep only selected variables</li>
    <li>OFFSET/LIMIT - chop the number solutions (best used with ORDER BY)</li>
    <li>ORDER BY - sorted results</li>
    <li>DISTINCT - yield only one row for one combination of variables and 
    values.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The solution modifiers OFFSET/LIMIT and ORDER BY always apply to all result 
  forms.&nbsp; </p>
  <h3>OFFSET and LIMIT</h3>
  <p>A set of solutions can be abbreviated by specifying the offset (the start 
  index) and the limit (the number of solutions) to be returned. Using LIMIT 
  alone can be useful to ensure not too many solutions are returned, to restrict 
  the effect of some unexpected situation.&nbsp; LIMIT and OFFSET can be used in 
  conjunction with sorting to take a defined slice through the solutions found.</p>
  <h3>ORDER BY</h3>
  <p>SPARQL solutions are sorted by expression, including custom functions.</p>
  <pre class="box">ORDER BY ?x ?y</pre>
  <pre class="box">ORDER BY DESC(?x)</pre>
  <pre class="box">ORDER BY x:func(?x)	# Custom sorting condition</pre>
  <h3>DISTINCT</h3>
  <p>The SELECT result form can take the DISTINCT modifier which ensures that no 
  two solutions returned are the same - this takes place after projection to the 
  requested variables.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>SELECT</h2>
  <p>The <code>SELECT</code> result form is a projection, with DISTINCT applied, 
  of the solution set. <code>SELECT</code> identifies which named variables are 
  in the result set.&nbsp; This may be &quot;<code>*</code>&quot; meaning &quot;all named 
  variables&quot; (blank nodes in the query act like variables for matching but are 
  never returned).</p>
  <h2>CONSTRUCT</h2>
  <p>CONSTRUCT builds an RDF based on a graph template.&nbsp; The graph template 
  can have variables which are bound by a WHERE clause.&nbsp; The effect is to 
  calculate the graph fragment, given the template, for each solution from the 
  WHERE clause, after taking into account any solution modifiers. The graph 
  fragments, one per solution, are merged into a single RDF graph which is the 
  result.</p>
  <p>Any blank nodes explicitly mentioned in the graph template are created 
  afresh for each time the template is used for a solution.</p>
  <h2>DESCRIBE</h2>
  <p>The CONSTRUCT form, takes an application template for the graph results. 
  The DESCRIBE form also creates a graph but the form of that graph is provided 
  the query processor, not the application. For each URI found, or explicitly 
  mentioned in the DESCRIBE clause, the query processor should provide a useful 
  fragment of RDF, such as all the known details of a book. ARQ allows 
  domain-specific description handlers to be written.</p>
  <h2>ASK</h2>
  <p>The ASK result form returns a boolean, true of the pattern matched 
  otherwise false.</p>

<h1 class="sectionHeading">Jena 2 OWL 2 RL Support</h1>

<p>
<a href="TODO">OWL 2 RL</a> is a profile of the <a href="TODO">OWL 2</a> web
ontology language intended to be implementable by means of rule based inference.
<p>

<p>
In partnership with the University of Aberdeen we have implemented an
experimental OWL 2 RL reasoner for Jena. This functions by translating an OWL 2 RL
ontology to a set of custom JenaRules using the translation approach described in 
<a href="TODO">RIF OWL2RL</a>. The resulting rule based reasoner can be applied to the
to OWL 2 RL ontology (or other compatible RDF files) to detect inconsistencies or deduce new assertions based on the
RDF semantics for OWL 2 RL. </p>

<p>
We aim to do a preliminary release of this reasoner as part of a future Jena update,
in the near future. </p>

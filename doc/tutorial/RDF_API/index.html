<h1>An Introduction to RDF and the Jena RDF API</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Preface</h2>

This is a tutorial introduction to both W3C's Resource Description Framework
(RDF) and Jena, a Java API for RDF.  It is written for the programmer who is
unfamiliar with RDF and who learns best by prototyping, or, for other
reasons, wishes to move quickly to implementation. Some familiarity
with both XML and Java is assumed.

<p>Implementing too quickly, without first understanding the RDF data model,
leads to frustration and disappointment. Yet studying the data model
alone is dry stuff and often leads to tortuous metaphysical conundrums.  It
is better to approach understanding both the data model and how to use it in
parallel. Learn a bit of the data model and try it out. Then
learn a bit more and try that out. Then the theory informs the practice
and the practice the theory. The data model is quite simple, so this
approach does not take long.</p>

<p>RDF has an XML syntax and many who are familiar with XML will think of RDF
in terms of that syntax. This is mistake. RDF should be
understood in terms of its data model. RDF data can be represented in
XML, but understanding the syntax is secondary to understanding the data
model.</p>

<p>An implementation of the Jena API, including the working source code for
all the examples used in this tutorial can be downloaded from <a

<h2><a name="ch-Introduction" id="ch-Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard (technically a W3C
Recommendation) for describing resources. What is a resource?  That is
rather a deep question and the precise definition is still the subject of
debate.  For our purposes we can think of it as anything we can identify.
You are a resource, as is your home page, this tutorial, the number one and
the great white whale in Moby Dick.</p>

<p>Our examples in this tutorial will be about people.  They use an <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vcard-rdf">RDF representation of VCARDS</a>.  RDF
is best thought of in the form of node and arc diagrams.  A simple vcard
might look like this in RDF:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="figures/fig1.png" alt="figure 1"></p>

<p>The <a href="#glos-Resource"><i>resource</i></a>, John Smith, is shown as
an elipse and is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)<font
size="1"><sup><a href="#fn-01">1</a></sup></font>,  in this case
"http://.../JohnSmith".  If you try to access that resource using your
browser, you are unlikely to be successful; April the first jokes not
withstanding, you would be rather surprised if your browser were able to
deliver John Smith to your desk top. If you are unfamiliar with URI's,
think of them simply as rather strange looking names.</p>

<p>Resources have <a href="#glos-Property"><i>properties</i></a>.  In these
examples we are interested in the sort of properties that would appear on
John Smith's business card. Figure 1 shows only one property, John
Smith's full name.  A property is represented by an arc, labeled with the
name of a property.  The name of a property is also a URI, but as URI's are
rather long and cumbersome, the diagram shows it in XML qname form.   The
part before the ':' is called a namespace prefix and represents a
namespace. The part after the ':' is called a local name and represents
a name in that namespace. Properties are usually represented in this
qname form when written as RDF XML and it is a convenient shorthand for
representing them in diagrams and in text. Strictly, however,
properties are identified by a URI. The nsprefix:localname form is a
shorthand for the URI of the namespace concatenated with the localname.
There is no requirement that the URI of a property resolve to anything when
accessed by a browser.</p>

<p>Each property has a value. In this case the value is a <a
href="#glos-Literal"><i>literal</i></a>, which for now we can think of as a
strings of characters<font size="1"><sup><a href="#fn-02">2</a></sup></font>.
Literals are shown in rectangles.</p>

<p>Jena is a Java API which can be used to create and manipulate RDF graphs
like this one. Jena has object classes to represent graphs, resources,
properties and literals. The interfaces representing resources,
properties and literals are called Resource, Property and Literal
respectively. In Jena, a graph is called a model and is represented by the Model
interface.</p>

<p>The code to create this graph, or model, is simple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// some definitions
static String personURI    = "http://somewhere/JohnSmith";
static String fullName     = "John Smith";

// create an empty Model
Model model = ModelFactory.createDefaultModel();

// create the resource
Resource johnSmith = model.createResource(personURI);

// add the property
 johnSmith.addProperty(VCARD.FN, fullName);</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It begins with some constant definitions and then creates an empty Model
or model, using the <code>ModelFactory</code> method <code>createDefaultModel()</code>
to create a memory-based model. Jena contains other implementations
of the Model interface, e.g one which uses a relational database: these
types of Model are also available from ModelFactory.</p>

<p>The John Smith resource is then created and a property added to it.
The property is provided by a "constant" class VCARD which holds objects
representing all the definitions in the VCARD schema.  Jena provides constant
classes for other well known schemas, such as RDF and RDF schema themselves,
Dublin Core and DAML.</p>

<p>The code to create the resource and add the property, can be more
compactly written in a cascading style:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>Resource johnSmith =
        model.createResource(personURI)
             .addProperty(VCARD.FN, fullName);</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The working code for this example can be found in the tutorial package of
the Jena distribution as <a href="code/Tutorial01.java">tutorial 1</a>.  As
an exercise, take this code and modify it to create a simple VCARD for
yourself.</p>

<p>Now let's add some more detail to the vcard, exploring some more features
of RDF and Jena.</p>

<p>In the first example, the property value was a literal. RDF
properties can also take other resources as their value.  Using a common RDF
technique, this example shows how to represent the different parts of John
Smith's name:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="figures/fig2.png" alt="figure 2"></p>

<p>Here we have added a new property, vcard:N, to represent the structure of
John Smith's name.  There are several things of interest about this
Model. Note that the vcard:N property takes a resource as its value.
Note also that the ellipse representing the compound name has no URI.
It is known as an <i><a href="#glos-blank node">blank Node</a>.</i></p>

<p>The Jena code to construct this example, is again very simple. First
some declarations and the creation of the empty model.</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// some definitions
String personURI    = "http://somewhere/JohnSmith";
String givenName    = "John";
String familyName   = "Smith";
String fullName     = givenName + " " + familyName;

// create an empty Model
Model model = ModelFactory.createDefaultModel();

// create the resource
//   and add the properties cascading style
Resource johnSmith
  = model.createResource(personURI)
         .addProperty(VCARD.FN, fullName)
         .addProperty(VCARD.N,
                      model.createResource()
                           .addProperty(VCARD.Given, givenName)
                           .addProperty(VCARD.Family, familyName));</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The working code for this example can be found as <a
href="code/Tutorial02.java">tutorial 2</a> in the tutorial package of the
Jena distribution.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-Statements">Statements</a></h2>

<p>Each arc in an RDF Model is called a <i><a
href="#glos-Statement">statement</a></i>. Each statement asserts a fact
about a resource. A statement has three parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the <i><a href="#glos-Subject"> subject</a></i> is the resource from
    which the arc leaves</li>
  <li>the <i><a href="#glos-Predicate"> predicate</a></i> is the property
    that labels the arc</li>
  <li>the <i><a href="#glos-Object"> object</a></i> is the resource or
    literal pointed to by the arc</li>
</ul>

<p>A statement is sometimes called a <a href="#glos-Triple">triple</a>,
because of its three parts.</p>

<p>An RDF Model is represented as a <i>set</i> of statements.  Each call of
<code>addProperty</code> in tutorial2 added a another statement to the Model.
(Because a Model is set of statements, adding a duplicate of a statement has no
effect.)  The Jena model interface defines a <code>listStatements()</code>
method which returns an <code>StmtIterator</code>, a subtype of Java's
<code>Iterator</code> over all all the statements in a Model.
<code>StmtIterator</code> has a method <code>nextStatement()</code>
which returns the next statement from the iterator (the same one that
<code>next()</code> would deliver, already cast to <code>Statement</code>).
The <code>Statement</code> interface provides accessor
methods to the subject, predicate and object of a statement.</p>

<p>Now we will use that interface to extend tutorial2 to list all the
statements created and print them out.  The complete code for this can be
found in <a href="code/Tutorial03.java">tutorial 3</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>// list the statements in the Model
StmtIterator iter = model.listStatements();

// print out the predicate, subject and object of each statement
while (iter.hasNext()) {
    Statement stmt      = iter.nextStatement();  // get next statement
    Resource  subject   = stmt.getSubject();     // get the subject
    Property  predicate = stmt.getPredicate();   // get the predicate
    RDFNode   object    = stmt.getObject();      // get the object

    System.out.print(subject.toString());
    System.out.print(" " + predicate.toString() + " ");
    if (object instanceof Resource) {
       System.out.print(object.toString());
    } else {
        // object is a literal
        System.out.print(" \"" + object.toString() + "\"");
    }

    System.out.println(" .");
} </code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the object of a statement can be either a resource or a literal, the
<code>getObject()</code> method returns an
object typed as <code>RDFNode</code>, which is a
common superclass of both <code>Resource</code>
and <code>Literal</code>.  The underlying object
is of the appropriate type, so the code uses <code>instanceof</code> to
determine which and
processes it accordingly.</p>

<p>When run, this program should produce output resembling:</p>
<pre><code>http://somewhere/JohnSmith http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0#N anon:14df86:ecc3dee17b:-7fff .
anon:14df86:ecc3dee17b:-7fff http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0#Family  "Smith" .
anon:14df86:ecc3dee17b:-7fff http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0#Given  "John" .
http://somewhere/JohnSmith http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0#FN  "John Smith" .</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>Now you know why it is clearer to draw Models.  If you look carefully, you
will see that each line consists of three fields representing the subject,
predicate and object of each statement.  There are four arcs in the Model, so
there are four statements.  The "anon:14df86:ecc3dee17b:-7fff" is an internal
identifier generated by Jena.  It is not a URI and should not be confused
with one.  It is simply an internal label used by the Jena implementation.</p>

<p>The W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/">RDFCore Working
Group</a> have defined a similar simple notation called <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/#ntriples">N-Triples</a>.  The name
means "triple notation".  We will see in the next section that Jena has an
N-Triples writer built in.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-Writing RDF">Writing RDF</a></h2>

<p>Jena has methods for reading and writing RDF as XML. These can be
used to save an RDF model to a file and later read it back in again.</p>

<p>Tutorial 3 created a model and wrote it out in triple form. <a
href="code/Tutorial04.java">Tutorial 4</a> modifies tutorial 3 to write the
model in RDF XML form to the standard output stream. The code again, is
very simple: <code>model.write</code> can take an <code>OutputStream</code>
argument.</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// now write the model in XML form to a file
model.write(System.out);</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The output should look something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>&lt;rdf:RDF
  xmlns:rdf='http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'
  xmlns:vcard='http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0#'
 &gt;
  &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about='http://somewhere/JohnSmith'&gt;
    &lt;vcard:FN&gt;John Smith&lt;/vcard:FN&gt;
    &lt;vcard:N rdf:resource='#A0'/&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
  &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about='#A0'&gt;
    &lt;vcard:Given&gt;John&lt;/vcard:Given&gt;
    &lt;vcard:Family&gt;Smith&lt;/vcard:Family&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>The RDF specifications specify how to represent RDF as XML. The RDF
XML syntax is quite complex.  The reader is referred to the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/">primer</a> being developed by the
RDFCore WG for a more detailed introduction.  However, let's take a quick look
at how to interpret the above.</p>

<p>RDF is usually embedded in an &lt;rdf:RDF&gt; element.  The element is
optional if there are other ways of know that some XML is RDF, but it is
usually present.  The RDF element defines the two namespaces used in the
document.  There is then an &lt;rdf:Description&gt; element which describes
the resource whose URI is "http://somewhere/JohnSmith".  If the rdf:about
attribute was missing, this element would represent a blank node.</p>

<p>The &lt;vcard:FN&gt; element describes a property of the resource.  The
property name is the "FN" in the vcard namespace.  RDF converts this to a URI
reference by concatenating the URI reference for the namespace prefix and
"FN", the local name part of the name.  This gives a URI reference of
"http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0#FN".  The value of the property
is the literal "John Smith".</p>

<p>The &lt;vcard:N&gt; element is a resource.  In this case the resource is
represented by a relative URI reference.  RDF converts this to an absolute
URI reference by concatenating it with the base URI of the current
document.</p>

<p>There is an error in this RDF XML; it does not exactly represent the Model
we created.  The blank node in the Model has been given a URI reference.  It
is no longer blank.  The RDF/XML syntax is not capable of representing all
RDF Models; for example it cannot represent a blank node which is the object
of two statements.  The 'dumb' writer we used to write this RDF/XML  makes no
attempt to write correctly the subset of Models which can be written
correctly.  It gives a URI to each blank node, making it no longer blank.</p>

<p>Jena has an extensible interface which allows new writers for different
serialization languages for RDF to be easily plugged in.  The above call
invoked the standard 'dumb' writer.  Jena also includes a more sophisticated
RDF/XML writer which can be invoked by specifying another argument to the
<code>write()</code> method call:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// now write the model in XML form to a file
model.write(system.out, "RDF/XML-ABBREV");
 </code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This writer, the so called PrettyWriter, takes advantage of features of
the RDF/XML abbreviated syntax to write a Model more compactly.  It is also
able to preserve blank nodes where that is possible.  It is however, not
suitable for writing very large Models, as its performance is unlikely to be
acceptable.  To write large files and preserve blank nodes, write in
N-Triples format:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// now write the model in XML form to a file
model.write(system.out, "N-TRIPLE");
  </code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This will produce output similar to that of tutorial 3 which conforms to
the N-Triples specification.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-Reading RDF">Reading RDF</a></h2>

<p><a href="code/Tutorial05.java">Tutorial 5</a> demonstrates reading the
statements recorded in RDF XML form into a model. With this tutorial,
we have provided a small database of vcards in RDF/XML form.  The following
code will read it in and write it out. <em>Note that for this application to
run, the input file must be in a directory or jar on your classpath.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>
 // create an empty model
 Model model = ModelFactory.createDefaultModel();

 // use the class loader to find the input file
 InputStream in = Tutorial05.class
                               .getClassLoader()
                               .getResourceAsStream(inputFileName);
if (in == null) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                                 "File: " + inputFileName + " not found");
}

// read the RDF/XML file
model.read(new InputStreamReader(in), "");

// write it to standard out
model.write(system.out);
      </code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The second argument to the <code>read()</code> method call is the URI which will
be used for resolving relative URI's.  As there are no relative URI
references in the test file, it is allowed to be empty. When run, <a
href="code/Tutorial05.java"> tutorial 5</a> will produce XML output which
looks like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>&lt;rdf:RDF

<h2><a name="ch-Jena RDF Packages">Jena RDF Packages</a></h2>

<p>Jena is a Java API for semantic web applications.  The key RDF package for
the application developer is
<code>com.hp.hpl.jena.rdf.model</code>. The API has been defined
in terms of interfaces so that application code can work with different
implementations without change. This package contains interfaces for
representing models, resources, properties, literals, statements and all the
other key concepts of RDF, and a ModelFactory for creating models.  So that
application code remains independent of
the implementation, it is best if it uses interfaces wherever possible, not
specific class implementations.</p>

<p>The <code>com.hp.hpl.jena.tutorial</code> package contains the
working source code for all the examples used in this tutorial.</p>

<p>The <code>com.hp.hpl.jena...impl</code> packages contains
implementation classes which may be common to many implementations. For
example, they defines classes <code>ResourceImpl</code>,
<code>PropertyImpl</code>, and <code>LiteralImpl</code> which may be
used directly or subclassed by different implementations. Applications
should rarely, if ever, use these classes directly. For example, rather
than creating a new instance of <code>ResourceImpl</code>, it is better to
use the <code>createResource</code> method of whatever model is being
used. That way, if the model implementation has used an optimized
implementation of <code>Resource</code>, then no conversions between the two
types will be necessary.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-Navigating a Model">Navigating a Model</a></h2>

<p>So far, this tutorial has dealt mainly with creating, reading and writing
RDF Models. It is now time to deal with accessing information held in a
Model.</p>

<p>Given the URI of a resource, the resource object can be retrieved from a
model using the <code>Model.getResource(String uri)</code> method. This
method is defined to return a Resource object if one exists in the model, or
otherwise to create a new one. For example, to retrieve the Adam Smith
resource from the model read in from the file in tutorial 5:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// retrieve the John Smith vcard resource from the model
Resource vcard = model.getResource(johnSmithURI);</code>
  </code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The Resource interface defines a number of methods for accessing the
properties of a resource. The <code>Resource.getProperty(Property
p)</code> method accesses a property of the resource. This method does
not follow the usual Java accessor convention in that the type of the object
returned is <code>Statement,</code> not the <code>Property</code> that you
might have expected.  Returning the whole statement allows the application to
access the value of the property using one of its accessor methods which
return the object of the statement. For example to retrieve the
resource which is the value of the <code>vcard:N</code> property:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// retrieve the value of the N property
Resource name = (Resource) vcard.getProperty(VCARD.N)
                                .getObject();</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In general, the object of a statement could be a resource or a literal, so
the application code, knowing the value must be a resource, casts the
returned object. One of the things that Jena tries to do is to provide
type specific methods so the application does not have to cast and type
checking can be done at compile time. The code fragment above, can be
more conveniently written:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// retrieve the value of the FN property
Resource name = vcard.getProperty(VCARD.N)
                     .getResource();</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, the literal value of a property can be retrieved:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// retrieve the given name property
String fullName = vcard.getProperty(VCARD.FN)
                        .getString();</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In this example, the vcard resource has only one <code>vcard:FN</code> and
one <code>vcard:N</code> property. RDF permits a resource to repeat a
property; for example Adam might have more than one nickname.  Let's give him
two:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// add two nickname properties to vcard
vcard.addProperty(VCARD.NICKNAME, "Smithy")
     .addProperty(VCARD.NICKNAME, "Adman");</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>As noted before, Jena represents an RDF Model as <em>set </em>of
statements, so adding a statement with the subject, predicate and object as
one already in the Model will have no effect.  Jena does not define which of
the two nicknames present in the Model will be returned.  The result of
calling <code>vcard.getProperty(VCARD.NICKNAME)</code> is indeterminate. Jena
will return one of the values, but there is no guarantee even that two
consecutive calls will return the same value.</p>

<p>If it is possible that a property may occur more than once, then the
Resource.listProperties(Property p) method can be used to return an iterator
which will list them all.  This method returns an iterator which returns
objects of type <code>Statement</code>.  We can list the nicknames like
this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// set up the output
System.out.println("The nicknames of \""
                      + fullName + "\" are:");
// list the nicknames
StmtIterator iter = vcard.listProperties(VCARD.NICKNAME);
while (iter.hasNext()) {
    System.out.println("    " + iter.nextStatement()
                                    .getObject()
                                    .toString());
}</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This code can be found in <a href="code/Tutorial06.java"> tutorial 6</a>,
which produces the following output when run:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>The nicknames of "John Smith" are:
    Smithy
    Adman</code></pre>

<p>All the properties of a resource can be listed by using the
<code>listStatements()</code> method without an argument.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-Querying a Model">Querying a Model</a></h2>

<p>The previous section dealt with the case of navigating a model from a
resource with a known URI. This section deals with searching a
model. The core Jena API supports only a limited query primitive.  The
more powerful query facilities of RDQL are described elsewhere.</p>

<p>The <code>Model.listStatements()</code> method, which lists all the
statements in a model, is perhaps the crudest way of querying a model.
Its use is not recommended on very large Models.
<code>Model.listSubjects()</code> is similar, but returns an iterator over
all resources that have properties, <i>ie</i> are the subject of some
statement.</p>

<p><code>Model.listSubjectsWithProperty(Property p, RDFNode
o)</code><code></code> will return an iterator over all the resources which
have property <code>p</code> with value <code>o</code>. We might expect
to be able to use the rdf:type property to retrieve all the vcard resources
by searching for their type property:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// retrieve all resource of type Vcard.
ResIterator iter = model.listSubjectsWithProperty(RDF.type, VCARD.Vcard);</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, however, the vcard schema we are using does not define a
type for vcards!  However, if we assume that only resources of type vcard
will have <code>vcard:FN</code> property, and that in our data, all such
resources have such a property, then we can find all the vcards like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// list vcards
ResIterator iter = model.listSubjectsWithProperty(VCARD.FN);
while (iter.hasNext()) {
    Resource r = iter.nextResource();
    ...
}</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>All these query methods are simply syntactic sugar over a primitive query
method <code>model.listStatements(Selector s)</code>.  This method returns an
iterator over all the statements in the model 'selected' by <code>s</code>.
The selector interface is designed to be extensible, but for now, there is
only one implementation of it, the class <code>SimpleSelector</code> from the
package <code>com.hp.hpl.jena.rdf.model</code>.  Using
<code>SimpleSelector </code>is one of the rare occasions in Jena when it is
necessary to use a specific class rather than an interface.  The
<code>SimpleSelector</code> constructor takes three arguments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>Selector selector = new SimpleSelector(subject, predicate, object)
  </code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This selector will select all statements with a subject that matches
<code>subject</code>, a predicate that matches <code>predicate</code> and an
object that matches <code>object</code>.  If a <code>null</code>is supplied
in any of the positions, it matches anything; otherwise they match corresponding
equal resources or literals. (Two resources are equal if they have equal URIs
or are the same blank node; two literals are the same if all their components
are equal.) Thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>Selector selector = new SimpleSelector(null, null, null);
  </code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>will select all the statements in a Model.</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>Selector selector = new SimpleSelector(null, VCARD.FN, null);
  </code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>will select all the statements with VCARD.FN as their predicate, whatever
the subject or object. As a special shorthand,

<blockquote><code>listStatements( S, P, O )
</code></blockquote>

is equivalent to

<blockquote><code>listStatements( new SimpleSelector( S, P, O ) )
</code></blockquote>




<p></p>The following code, which can be found in full in <a
href="code/Tutorial07.java">tutorial 7</a> lists the full names on all the
vcards in the database.</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// select all the resources with a VCARD.FN property
ResIterator iter = model.listSubjectsWithProperty(VCARD.FN);
if (iter.hasNext()) {
    System.out.println("The database contains vcards for:");
    while (iter.hasNext()) {
        System.out.println("  " + iter.nextStatement()
                                      .getProperty(VCARD.FN)
                                      .getString());
    }
} else {
    System.out.println("No vcards were found in the database");
}
            </code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This should produce output similar to the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>The database contains vcards for:
  Sarah Jones
  John Smith
  Matt Jones
  Becky Smith
  </code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Your next exercise is to modify this code to use <code>SimpleSelector
</code>instead of <code>listSubjectsWithProperty</code>.</p>

<p>Lets see how to implement some finer control over the statements selected.
<code>SimpleSelector</code> can be subclassed and its selects method modified
to perform further filtering:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// select all the resources with a VCARD.FN property
// whose value ends with "Smith"
StmtIterator iter = model.listStatements(
    new SimpleSelector(null, VCARD.FN, (RDFNode) null) {
        public boolean selects(Statement s)
            {return s.getString().endsWith("Smith");}
    });</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This sample code uses a neat Java technique of overridding a method
definition inline when creating an instance of the class.  Here the
<code>selects(...)</code> method checks to ensure that the full name ends
with "Smith".  It is important to note that filtering based on the subject,
predicate and object arguments takes place before the
<code>selects(...)</code> method is called, so the extra test will only be
applied to matching statements.</p>

<p>The full code can be found in <a href="code/Tutorial08.java">tutorial
8</a> and produces output like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>The database contains vcards for:
  John Smith
  Becky Smith</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>You might think that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// do all filtering in the selects method
StmtIterator iter = model.listStatements(
  new
      SimpleSelector(null, null, (RDFNode) null) {
          public boolean selects(Statement s) {
              return (subject == null   || s.getSubject().equals(subject))
                  &amp;&amp; (predicate == null || s.getPredicate().equals(predicate))
                  &amp;&amp; (object == null    || s.getObject().equals(object))
          }
     }
 });</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>is equivalent to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>StmtIterator iter =
  model.listStatements(new SimpleSelector(subject, predicate, object)</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Whilst functionally they may be equivalent, the first form will list all
the statements in the Model and test each one individually, whilst the second
allows indexes maintained by the implementation to improve performance.  Try
it on a large Model and see for yourself, but make a cup of coffee first.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-Operations on Models">Operations on Models</a></h2>

<p>Jena provides three operations for manipulating Models as a whole.  These
are the common set operations of union, intersection and difference.</p>

<p>The union of two Models is the union of the sets of statements which
represent each Model.  This is one of the key operations that the design of
RDF supports.  It enables data from disparate data sources to be merged.
Consider the following two Models:</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img alt="figure 4" src="figures/fig4.png">and
<img alt="figure 5" src="figures/fig5.png"></p>

<p>When these are merged, the two http://...JohnSmith nodes are merged into
one and the duplicate <code>vcard:FN</code> arc is dropped to produce:</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img alt="figure 6" src="figures/fig6.png"></p>

<p>Lets look at the code to do this (the full code is in <a
href="code/Tutorial09.java">tutorial 9</a>) and see what happens.</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// read the RDF/XML files
model1.read(new InputStreamReader(in1), "");
model2.read(new InputStreamReader(in2), "");

// merge the Models
Model model = model1.union(model2);

// print the Model as RDF/XML
model.write(system.out, "RDF/XML-ABBREV");</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The output produced by the pretty writer looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
&lt;rdf:RDF
    xmlns:rdf='http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'
    xmlns:vcard='http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0#'&gt;
    &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about='http://somewhere/JohnSmith/'&gt;
        &lt;vcard:N
             vcard:Given='John'
             vcard:Family='Smith'/&gt;
        &lt;vcard:FN&gt;John Smith&lt;/vcard:FN&gt;
        &lt;vcard:EMAIL
             rdf:value='John@somewhere.com'
             rdf:type='http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0#internet'/&gt;
    &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
  </code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if you are unfamiliar with the details of the RDF/XML syntax, it
should be reasonably clear that the Models have merged as expected.  The
intersection and difference of the Models can be computed in a similar
manner.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-Containers" id="ch-Containers">Containers</a></h2>

<p>RDF defines a special kind of resources for representing collections of
things. These resources are called <i>containers</i>. The members of a
container can be either literals or resources. There are three kinds of
container:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a BAG is an unordered collection</li>
  <li>an ALT is an unordered collection intended to represent
  alternatives</li>
  <li>a SEQ is an ordered collection</li>
</ul>

<p>A container is represented by a resource. That resource will have an
rdf:type property whose value should be one of rdf:Bag, rdf:Alt or rdf:Seq,
or a subclass of one of these, depending on the type of the container.
The first member of the container is the value of the container's rdf:_1
property; the second member of the container is the value of the container's
rdf:_2 property and so on. The rdf:_nnn properties are known as the
<i>ordinal properties</i>.</p>

<p>For example, the Model for a simple bag containing the vcards of the
Smith's might look like this:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="figures/fig3.png" alt="figure 3"></p>

<p align="left">Whilst the members of the bag are represented by the
properties rdf:_1, rdf:_2 etc the ordering of the properties is not
significant. We could switch the values of the rdf:_1 and rdf:_2
properties and the resulting Model would represent the same information.</p>

<p align="left">Alt's are intended to represent alternatives. For
example, lets say a resource represented a software product. It might
have a property to indicate where it might be obtained from. The value
of that property might be an Alt collection containing various sites from
which it could be downloaded. Alt's are unordered except that the
rdf:_1 property has special significance. It represents the default
choice.</p>

<p align="left">Whilst containers can be handled using the basic machinery of
resources and properties, Jena has explicit interfaces and implementation
classes to handle them. It is not a good idea to have an object
manipulating a container, and at the same time to modify the state of that
container using the lower level methods.</p>

<p align="left">Let's modify tutorial 8 to create this bag:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// create a bag
Bag smiths = model.createBag();

// select all the resources with a VCARD.FN property
// whose value ends with "Smith"
StmtIterator iter = model.listStatements(
    new SimpleSelector(null, VCARD.FN, (RDFNode) null) {
        public boolean selects(Statement s) {
                return s.getString().endsWith("Smith");
        }
    });
// add the Smith's to the bag
while (iter.hasNext()) {
    smiths.add(iter.next().getSubject());
}</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If we write out this Model, it contains something like the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>&lt;rdf:RDF
  xmlns:rdf='http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'
  xmlns:vcard='http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0#'
 &gt;
...
  &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about='#A3'&gt;
    &lt;rdf:type rdf:resource='http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Bag'/&gt;
    &lt;rdf:_1 rdf:resource='http://somewhere/JohnSmith/'/&gt;
    &lt;rdf:_2 rdf:resource='http://somewhere/RebeccaSmith/'/&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>which represents the Bag resource.</p>

<p>The container interface provides an iterator to list the contents of a
container:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// print out the members of the bag
NodeIterator iter2 = smiths.iterator();
if (iter2.hasNext()) {
    System.out.println("The bag contains:");
    while (iter2.hasNext()) {
        System.out.println("  " +
            (Resource) iter2.next())
                            .getProperty(VCARD.FN)
                            .getString());
    }
} else {
    System.out.println("The bag is empty");
}</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>which produces the following output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>The bag contains:
  John Smith
  Becky Smith</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Executable example code can be found in <a href="code/Tutorial10.java">
tutorial 10</a>.</p>

<p>The Jena classes offer methods for manipulating containers including
adding new members, inserting new members into the middle of a container and
removing existing members.  The Jena container classes currently ensure that
the the list of ordinal properties used starts at rdf:_1 and is contiguous.
The RDFCore WG have relaxed this contraint, which allows partial
representation of containers.  This therefore is an area of Jena may be
changed in the future.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch-More about Literals and Datatypes">More about Literals and
Datatypes</a></h2>

<p>RDF literals are not just simple strings.  Literals may have a language
tag to indicate the language of the literal.  The literal "chat" with an
English language tag is considered different to the literal "chat" with a
French language tag.  This rather strange behaviour is an artefact of the
original RDF/XML syntax.</p>

<p>Further there are really two sorts of Literals.  In one, the string
component is just that, an ordinary string.  In the other the string
component is expected to be a well balanced fragment of XML.  When an RDF
Model is written as RDF/XML a special construction using a
parseType='Literal' attribute is used to represent it.</p>

<p>In Jena, these attributes of a literal may be set when the literal is
constructed, e.g. in <a href="code/Tutorial11.java">tutorial 11</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// create the resource
Resource r = model.createResource();

// add the property
r.addProperty(RDFS.label, model.createLiteral("chat", "en"))
 .addProperty(RDFS.label, model.createLiteral("chat", "fr"))
 .addProperty(RDFS.label, model.createLiteral("&lt;em&gt;chat&lt;/em&gt;", true));

// write out the Model
model.write(system.out);</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>produces</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>&lt;rdf:RDF
  xmlns:rdf='http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#'
  xmlns:rdfs='http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#'
 &gt;
  &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about='#A0'&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:label xml:lang='en'&gt;chat&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:label xml:lang='fr'&gt;chat&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:label xml:lang='en' rdf:parseType='Literal'&gt;&lt;em&gt;chat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>For two literals to be considered equal, they must either both be XML
literals or both be simple literals.  In addition, either both must have no
language tag, or if language tags are present they must be equal.  For simple
literals the strings must be equal.  XML literals have two notions of
equality.  The simple notion is that the conditions previously mentioned are
true and the strings are also equal.  The other notion is that they can be
equal if the cannonicalization of their strings is equal.</p>

<p>Jena's interfaces also support typed literals. The old-fashioned way
(shown below) treats typed literals as shorthand for strings: type typed
values are connverted in the usual Java way to strings and these strings
are store din the Model. For example, try (noting that for
simple literals, we can omit the <code>model.createLiteral</code>(...)
call):</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>// create the resource
Resource r = model.createResource();

// add the property
r.addProperty(RDFS.label, "11")
 .addProperty(RDFS.label, 11);

// write out the Model
model.write(system.out, "N-TRIPLE");</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The output produced is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>_:A... &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label&gt; "11" .</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Since both literals are really just the string "11", then only one
statement is added.</p>

<p>The RDFCore WG has defined mechanisms for supporting datatypes in RDF.
Jena suports these using the <i>typed literal</i> mechanisms; they are
not discussed in this tutorial.</p>

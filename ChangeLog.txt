ChangeLog for ARQ
=================

==== ARQ 2.8.3

+ Bug fix: some multiply nested OPTIONALs could result in only naive, unoptimized execution. 
+ Bug fix: SERVICE body for complex query patterns. 

==== ARQ 2.8.2

+ SPARQL v1.1 as an defined language and parser, separate from ARQ 
+ Results output in CSV
+ Optimization of disjunction FILTERs 
    with care to get same effects if value-based
    URIs are always safe to optimize. 
+ Bug fix in filter placement (in code used by TDB only) 
+ Bug fix in filter equality transformation if involving unused an variable.

==== ARQ 2.8.1

+ Bug fixes
   + substitution in NOT EXISTS
   + substitution in assignment
   + constant folding and logical special forms
   + bad lock allocation (only occurs under very high load)

+ Speed up processing of nested optionals.  Greatly speeds up BSBM with TDB.

+ Some JMX management exposed: Object names start "com.hp.hpl.jena.sparql". 
  Details include: system and version information, query execution count, 
    last query and the time execution started.

==== ARQ 2.8.0

+ Build is now done by maven
** JAR changes: the ARQ jars are now called "arq.jar" and "arq-tests.jar".
   Only "arq.jar is needed at runtime unless running ARQ test code. 
** There is only one maven artifact "arq".  "arq-extra" is no more.
  See README for deatils of files produced.

+ Negation-as-failure: NOT EXISTS {pattern}
  see http://jena.sf.net/ARQ/negation.html for details.

+ Bug fix: Reverse paths of length 3 or more were not being parsed correctly.

+ Upgrade to stax 1.0.1 and wstx-asl-3.2.9

+ Remove json.jar (jena compiled code from org.json).  Replace with source code, renamed, in ARQ itself. 
  package com.hp.hpl.jena.sparql.lib.org.json;
  Cleaned up for Java generics.

==== ARQ 2.7.0

+ New build system.

+ Clearing up.
    junit used is now v4.5
    internal logging API is SLF4J (Jena uses SLF4J as of v 2.6.0 as well)
    Jars needed:  slf4j-api-1.5.6.jar and (for log4j) slf4j-log4j12-1.5.6.jar
    
+ Optimizer framework rewritten (inc support for hooks used by TDB).
  New general purpose StateGenerator and memory-graphs statistics    

+ Fix parsing of very large INSERT DATA requests (stack could overflow).

+ The IndexBuilder constructors taking a directory name as a string would 
  clear the Lucene index.  Changed so they do not do so - and behave like
  the other constructors which reuse an existing index.   

+ Uses the Java5 version of Jena2. 

+ Property function afp:versionARQ does not now split version numbers into major and minor parts
  ARQ has a 3-part version number now.

==== ARQ 2.6.0

+ Added .close() to Dataset and GraphStore for those implementations that
  need to make changes permanent or release system resources.  

+ Clean internal extensions points for TDB

+ Put misc support code in for TDB

+ Fix bug in SPARQL grammar (!) : expressions like "1+2*3" did not parse.  
  This is a fix to the grammar as published by the working group.  
   It does not invalidate or chnage any query that works - it makes some
   illegal syntax work that should work.

==== ARQ 2.5

+ Redesign of quad support. 
  AlgebraGeneratorQuad retired
  Use Algebra.toQuadForm(Op) to turn an algebra expression into quads.   

+ fn:string-join was misnamed - was actually renamed as fn:concat
  And now takes arbitrary number of arguments

+ Add afn:strjoin(str, string...) 

+ Bug fix: path parsing when "a" (for rdf:type) 
           is used in a property list (using ;) 

+ Bug fix: LET expressions did not eliminate solutions when
    assigned a new, different value.

+ Internal renaming to make the class names better reflect their role
  particularly not using the term "compile" for things now considered
  to happen during query execution.  

+ Internal utilities updated for TDB

+ Signal start/end of updates using the graph-level events mechanism.

==== ARQ 2.4

+ Change to interface for query compilation : Algebra.compile and Algebra.optimize 

+ Property paths added.  See documentation.
  
+ Simplify the interface between ARQ and data sources.
  StageGenerator example updated.   

==== ARQ 2.3

+ HAVING / ORDER BY variable, where variable is SELECT as an aggregate or computed value now works. 
  (current restriction: can't have the expression directly in the ORDER BY - need to project the variable)  

+ Upgrade to Lucene 2.3.1

+ Change return type of ResultFactor.copyResults to ResultSetRewinable (a sub interface of ResultSet).

+ Allow inital bindings for Updates (ignored unless a Modify operation)

+ Added SUM(?x) aggregate

+ Added { SELECT } (nested SELECT) and LET (assignment) to ARQ extended SPARQL.

+ Added optimization rewrite of algebra expressions for FILTER(?x = :x) and FILTER(sameTerm(?x, :x))
  so that the required term is substituted into the pattern before execution.
  Cautiously applied to basic graph patterns and quad patterns.
 
+ Bug fix: ARQ 2.2 broke property functions in many nested structures. 

+ src-examples: example of SPARQL/Update

+ Fix bug: OpUnion flattening was not happening (Main query engine, OpCompiler) 

+ Fix bug: HttQueryEngine(in HttpQuery) generated bad POST requests with a trailing &.

+ New command arq.load, which loads files into graphs.  Special case of arq.update

==== ARQ 2.2

+ Added command line tool, arq.update, for applying SPARQL/Update requests
  to a graph store or dataset described by an assembler file.

+ LARQ: 
  Remove restriction that indexes have to be closed for writing before reading
  Becare: in Lucene, reader indexes (like LARQIndexes) see the index as at the point
  in time when the index was created.  Must get a new reader to see later updates.

+ QueryEngineHTTP
  + Can be created via QueryExecutionFactory
  + Operations for adding HTTP parameters and also for basic authentication of HTTP.  

+ Added ParserRegistry (courtesy of Olaf Hartig)

+ Reworked property functions so they formally in the algebra.

+ Jar change: commons-logging-1.1.1.jar

+ Bug fix: text output of result sets sometimes gave full bNode label - revert to
  old design where a short label is used always.  

+ Bug fix: handling of empty patterns and COUNT could give no count,
  instead of a count of zero.  

+ Use base URI for realtive URI printing (i.e <foobar>)

+ Track DAWG:
  Effect of OPTIONAL {{ ... FILTER }} (must be 2 or more {{}}) changes.
  Inner {} now protects the FILTER from becoming part of the LeftJoin.  

+ Upgrade lucene-core-2.0.0.jar to lucene-2.2.0.jar
  Lucene change means that users can't mix ARQ 2.1, and before,
  with Lucene 2.1.0 or later.

==== ARQ 2.1

+ (experimental for this release - permanent in next)
  GROUP BY, HAVING
  Aggregates: count(*), count(?x), count(distinct *), count(distinct ?x)

+ (experimental for this release - permanent in next) 
  Expressions in SELECT clause
  Expression in brackets, optionally named with "AS ?var"
  Adding an explict namne is strongly encouraged especially if you use
  the SPARQL results format because internal variables variable names
  are not portable. 
    SELECT (?x+?y AS ?z) ?y ?x
    SELECT ?x ?y (?x+?y AS ?sum)  # Print a table of sums
  OpProject can have additional expressions that get added into the
    table from 'project'
  
+ removed old-style (and out-of-date) writers for internal forms: prefix,
  plain and XML forms of a SPARQL query.  The XML form was incomplete
  anyway.  (This does not affect algebra output which is what replaces
  these syntax-based forms).
  
+ Added examples of using Lisp (SISC - A Java-based scheme interpreter). 
  See the directory Lisp/. 
  
+ NodeVar renamed ExprVar (more consistent naming)
  Deprecated tombstones left for next release 

==== ARQ 2.1 beta

+ Cost-based optimizer for basic graph patterns on in-memory graphs. 
  ** Uses the version of jena shipped with this release, can't use an earlier one.   

+ Convert algebra expressions back into a SPARQL query (see OpToSyntax).

+ Old "NodeToLabelMap" => "NodeIsomorphismMap"
  Affects Element and Op ".equalTo" operation signature.

+ Added extension : a graph pattern SERVICE <serviceEndPoint> { pattern }
  ARQ syntax only.
  New algebra operation: OpService

+ Added SSE to the main codebase : http://jena.hpl.hp.com/wiki/SSE

+ Internal changes: the core engines are now Graph/DatasetGraph/Algebra-centric 
  and there are classes to map betwen that and the Model/Dataset.
  QueryEngine construction and extension need not know about
  the upper layers now.

+ Algebra operator implment .hashCode() and .equals() based on structure/value equality

+ Legacy query engine1 removed.

+ Add new algebra operations
  OpGroupAgg, OpNull
  
+ VarsMentionedVisitor removed - convert to an algebra expression and use OpVars.allVars instead.

==== ARQ 2.0

This version uses the SPARQL algebra directly,
then produces an execution scheme that uses streaming
execution where possible.

+ SPARQL changes
  + Prefixed names can now start with a digit.  ex:123 is now a legal prefix name.
  + The working group has removed attributes "ordered" and "distinct" from the
    XML Results format. These have been removed in this release.  ARQ will read
    old style XML files (and ignore the attributes).
    JSON result format also updated.

+ Multiple query engines:
  + Main query engine for optimization and efficient execution
  + Reference engine for checking functionality
    (implements the SPARQL evaluation semantics very simply for clarity and validation)
  + Remote access engine for querying SPARQL endpoints over HTTP.
  + Engine1, for exact ARQ1 semantics and enhancements
    (deprecated for new applications (and will be removed sometime))
  + RDQL engine
  + See also SDB - an ARQ query engine that for RDF stored in SQL databases 

+ Access and extension points:
   + Filter functions
   + Property functions
   + The parsed syntax
   + Generation of the SPARQL algebra expression
     + Modification of SPARQL algebra expression before executin plan generation
     + Custom algebra operations 
   + Basic graph pattern replacement or modification
     for access to other data sources
   + Modular query engine class hierarchy for reuse of machinary,
     resulting in less extra coding for extensions.
 
 + Internal changes
   + Package reorganisation
     Implemnentation in com.hp.hpl.jena.sparql
   + Filter functions now take a Context, not an ExecutionContext.
   + Deprecate "EXT" form from ARQ.
     (Property functions are better)
     
 + Experimental SPARQL/Update API
   See http://jena.hpl.hp.com/~afs/SPARQL-Update.html

Post ARQ-2.0-beta: 
+ Added REDUCED as per DAWG decision 2007-03-20
+ OpDistinct and OpReduce no longer take a variable list
+ Removed ElementExtension/PlanExtension and extension package
  The ARQ(beyond SPARQL feature) of "EXT" has been removed.
  Element visitors may be affected.
+ Added an update API
+ LARQ
	+ added access to the match score
	+ added limits on score or number of results as part of Lucene search

  * Free text search (provided by Lucene)
  * Property functions for defining calculated properties
  * Query inference graphs (Jena inference)
  * Framework for access to wrapped data sources (RDF and non-RDF) 
  * Client query engine for remote SPARQL services

ARQ includes a number of SPARQL extensions:

  * SPARQL/Update
  * GROUP BY/HAVING
  * Counting
  * Federated query : SERVICE - call-out to another query service 
  * Expressions in the SELECT clause

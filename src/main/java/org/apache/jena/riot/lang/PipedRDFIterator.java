/**
 * A {@code PipedRDFIterator} should be connected to a {@link PipedRDFStream} implementation;
 * the piped iterator then provides whatever RDF primitives are written to the {@code PipedRDFStream}.
 * Typically, data is read from a {@code PipedRDFIterator} by one thread and data is written
 * to the corresponding {@code PipedRDFStream} by some other thread.  Attempting to use both
 * objects from a single thread is not recommended, as it may deadlock the thread.
 * The {@code PipedRDFIterator} contains a buffer, decoupling read operations from write operations,
 * within limits.
 * <p/>
 * Inspired by Java's {@link java.io.PipedInputStream} and {@link java.io.PipedOutputStream}
 * 
 * @param <T> The type of the RDF primitive, should be one of {@code Triple}, {@code Quad}, or {@code Tuple<Node>}

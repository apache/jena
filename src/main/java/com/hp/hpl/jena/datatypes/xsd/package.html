			Provides datatype definitions for the XML Schema datatypes support by Jena.
                  This allows XSD typed literal to be used in RDF data. The static fields on
                  the class XSDDatatype provide instances of each of the datatype definitions but
                  these are preregistered with the TypeMapper.

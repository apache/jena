<title>Deprecation of DIG 1.0 interface</title>
</head>

<h1>Deprecation of DIG 1.0 interface</h1>
<p>With effect from Jena 2.6.0 onwards, we have taken the decision to remove
support for the DIG 1.0 external reasoner interface from Jena. DIG 1.0 is not an actively
supported interface specification, and few extant products implement it any more. Moreover, it
does not support a complete range of OWL inference operations. Users who wish
to continue to interface to an external reasoner while updating Jena
have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>(recommended) use the <a href="http://clarkparsia.com/pellet/">Pellet</a> reasoner,
which has a native Jena interface not dependent on DIG 1.0</li>
<li>retrieve the DIG 1.0 code from the Jena CVS repository on
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jena">SourceForge</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the latter case, if there is sufficient demand from the user-base we will provide an
easily accessible zip or tar archive of the DIG 1.0 sources. If you would benefit from such
an archive, please notify the developers via the
<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/jena-dev">Jena support list</a>.

/**
 * Rules employ builtins to do all tests and actions other than simple triple
 * matches and triple creation. 
 * <p>
 * Builtins can be invoked in two contexts. In the head of forward rules they perform
 * some action based on the variable bindings generated by the body and additional context
 * (the graph being reasoned over, the set of triples bound by the body). In the body
 * of rules they perform tests, and additional variable bindings.
 * <p>
 * The mapping from the rule definition (which uses functors to hold the parsed call)
 * to the java implementation of the builtin is done via the 
 * {@link BuiltinRegistry BuiltinRegistry} which can
 * be user extended.

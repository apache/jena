This package contains an example RDFS reasoner. It was developed partly to
test the reasoning API and support machinery though it is a complete and
reasonably useful RDFS implementation. It has since been replaced by
RDFSRuleReasoner which offers much better scaling. <br>
<p>All RDFS implementations need to make tradeoffs. This implementation is
intended to be complete (it can cope with metadata level declarations such
as declaring and using a subPropertyOf rdfs:subPropertyOf). It requires all
schema information to be loadable into main memory - the property and class
lattices are stored reasonably efficiently but they will often be the limiting
factor on size (and certainly on performance). These lattices are processed
at the time the reasoner is bound to the schema and instance data. However,
the rest of the RDFS inference rules will operate in a backwards chaining
mode so that significant processing will be required to answer a given query.
Highly ground queries will operate reasonably efficiently, queries with wildcards
in predicate slot will operate particularly inefficiently and will make redundant
passes across the data.<br>
</p>
<h3>Implementation notes</h3>
<p>The subClassOf and subPropertyOf relationships are cached in memory using
the TransitiveReasoner. This stores those relationships as explicit graphs
containing the full relationship closure. The direct links are represented
by direct versions of the subClassOf and subPropertyOf relations which can
be constructed using ReasonerFactory#makeDirect or found as class variables
on the TransitiveReasoner.<br>
</p>
<p>The schema rules such as domain, range and subPropertyOf inference are
also checked at the time the data is bound but the result is the addition
of a set of backward chaining rewrite rules which can match a given query
against possible inferences. &nbsp;For example the domain rule is:<br>
</p>
<pre>   ?p rdfs:domain ?z -&gt; ?s rdf:type ?z &lt;- ?s ?p _<br></pre>
<p>Thus the processing of a (p,domain,z) declaration generates a backward
rule of the form "if you are looking for something of type z then check if
there is any individual which is the subject of a p property.<br>
</p>
<p>All of these backward rules are implemented using the Graph iterators
together with some simple triple rewrite machinery.<br>
</p>
<p>One special case to be aware of is the processing of container membership
property entailments. By default the reasoner does a scan of the entire tbox+data
looking for properties of the form <i>rdf:_n</i> and for each one found it
asserts the appropriate entailments. This involves a pass over the whole
dataset (we take the opportunity to cache all [p,type, Property] and [p,
subPropertyOf,p] entailments at the same time). This behaviour can be switched
off using the configuration option [TODO: document] which considerably reduces
to the initial processing time but [x,type,containerMembershipProperty] and
[x,subPropertyOf,member] entailments will then be missed. This may or may
not be a useful trade-off depending on the application.</p>

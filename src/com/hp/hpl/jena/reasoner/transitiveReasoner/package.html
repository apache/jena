This package contains a reasoner which supports transitive-reflexive closure
of subPropertyOf and subClassOf relations. A single tbox can optionally be
bound, which is expected to contain schema information but can contain other
information as well. A single data graph can be bound - whch is allowed to
contain schema information in which case the work of scanning the tbox is
lost and has to be redone (because the data might define sub-properties of
subPropertOf or subClassOf which were missed in the original tbox scan).<br>
<p>The generated InfGraph will appear to contain the union of the data graph,
the tbox graph, the reflexive-transitive closure of any subPropertyOf and
subClassOf relations together with <i>direct</i> versions of these. <br>
</p>
<h3>Defects</h3>
<p>The current implementation is flawed in its handling of multiple data
bindings - you can't actually reuse the work of tbox binding across different
data sets. This will be fixed soon.<br>

/**
 * Java representation of a DAML Disjoint instance.  <b>Note that Disjoint has been removed
 * from the DAML spec, so this is really obsolete.</b> It is not marked deprecated since the
 * code to support legacy ontologies will then report a deprecation warning.  However, it
 * is strongly advised not to rely on the continued presence of this class.

/**
 * <p>
 * An enhanced view of a Jena model that is known to contain ontology
 * data, under a given ontology {@link Profile vocabulary} (such as OWL).
 * This class does by itself compute the deductive extension of the graph under
 * the semantic rules of the language.  Instead, we wrap an underlying graph
 * with this interface that presents a convenience syntax for accessing the
 * language elements. Depending on the capability of the inference graph, the
 * OntModel will appear to contain more or less triples. For example, if this
 * class is used to wrap a plain memory or database model, only the relationships
 * asserted by the document will be reported through this convenience API. 
 * Alternatively, if the OntModel wraps an inferencing graph, the inferred
 * triples from the extension will be reported as well. For example, assume the 
 * following ontology fragment:
 * <code><pre>
 *     :a rdf:type owl:Class .
 *     :b rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf :a .
 *     :widget rdf:type :b .
 * </pre></code>
 * In a non-inferencing graph, the <code>rdf:type</code> of the widget will be
 * reported as class <code>:b</code> only.  In a graph that can process the OWL
 * semantics, the widget's types will include <code>:b</code>, <code>:a</code>,
 * and <code>owl:Thing</code>.
 * </p>

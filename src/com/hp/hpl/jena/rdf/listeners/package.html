<p>A package defining some useful implementations of
<code>ModelChangedListener, for listening to 
(a) all triples added or removed, exploding composite objects,
(b) all objects added or removed, as themselves,
(c) notification of additions/removals, but no details,
and (d) accepting but ignoring all changes, as a base-class to

== ShExC parser

The ShExC parser produces the java object ShEx tree.

To make the parser:

Run the script

    shex-parser

which runs javacc to create the parser in 

../src/main/java/org/apache/jena/shex/parser/javacc

and cleans up the output files to remove or surpress Java warnings.

The generated javacc java is checked into git so you don't need to install
javacc to build this module unless you want to change the parser.

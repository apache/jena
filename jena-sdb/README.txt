SDB - SPARQL Database 
=====================

A database subsystem for Jena, optimized for SPARQL.

Note that SDB is currently in maintenance only mode, the Jena
developers are releasing it as a component and accepting patches
contributed to it but there is no active development.  This
component may return to active development in the future if
community members come forward to help support it.

The Jena developers recommend the TDB component for a much more
scalable and performant alternative though we appreciate that
many people may have a requirement to use SQL.

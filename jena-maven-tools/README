Jena Maven Tools

This project provides Apache Maven plugins that run Apache Jena
RDF processing tools from the command line.

Available plugins:

  * Jena Schemagen plugin
    The Schemagen tool in Apache Jena creates Java source files
    from OWL and RDF ontology documents, making it easy to include
    constants from an ontology directly in a Java project.


Changes

Version 0.4

  * Moved source code from org.openjena package tree to org.apache.jena
  * Removed some obsolete project artefacts (e.g. src/site)
  * Added license headers to conform to Apache Software Foundation policy,
    and added a rat:check target to the pom file.

Acknowledgements

  * Significant contributions to the schemagen plugin, and Maven plugin
    integration in general, were made by Shane StClair.

SERVICE on/off control
https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1906

Provide the ability to switch off all SERVICE processing completely.
Use
   Code: arq:httpServiceAllowed
   or http://jena.apache.org/ARQ#httpServiceAllowed=false
to disable.

e.g.
   fuseki-server --set arq:httpServiceAllowed=false ....

-- 

Additional restrictions and control for SPARQL script functions
   https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1908

There is a new Jena context setting
   http://jena.apache.org/ARQ#scriptAllowList
which is on the command line:
   arq:scriptAllowList
and java constant
   ARQ.symCustomFunctionScriptAllowList

Its value is a comma separated list of function names.
   "function1,function2"
Only the functions in this can be called from SPARQL.

As in Jena 4.8.0, the Java system property "jena:scripting" must also be 
set to "true" to enable script functions.

== RDF/XML reader changes.

* The RDF/XML parser has been converted to use the
  Jena IRI abstraction IRIx.
  https://github.com/apache/jena/issues/1773

Uses of RDF/XML read through RIOT (RDFDataMgr, RDFParser) and from the command line "riot" should see no changes except where both WARN and ERROR were reported, now only the ERROR happens.

Code that directly calls the RDF/XML parser will encounter the behaviour seen from RIOT. Relative IRIs will not be in the parsed data. IRI errors are reported as errors.

The original RDF/XML parser is still accessible:
https://jena.apache.org/documentation/io/rdfxml-io.html

From the command line: "riot --set xmlrdf:xmlrdf0=true ..."

This is the first part of a move to convert the RDF/XML parser to be consistent with the rest of Jena parsing

1. unified IRI treatment of error handling and reporting throughout Jena
2. improve maintainability
3. allow for alternative providers of IRI functionality

Announcement:
https://lists.apache.org/thread/63vtkb9hwzzd9mrmmxr2xsmd5zvw53vv

-- Bulk retrieval and caching for SERVICE clauses

There is a new module "jena-serviceenhancer", a contribution from Claus Stadler, for federated query, including caching remote data and controlling execution order for SERVICE.

https://jena.apache.org/documentation/query/service_enhancer.html

-- GeoSPARQL: GML handling.

GH-1299 - The GeoSPARQL has acknowledged a mistake in their documentation whereby the wrong namespace was being used for "gml:".
https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-geosparql/pull/334

This also leads to problems with interoperation with GML data sources.
Unfortunately the change impacts impacts existing data and any spatial indexes would will need to be deleted and rebuilt.

==== Apache Jena 4.5.0
Released: 2022-05-04
Issues: https://s.apache.org/jena-4.5.0-issues
Announcement:
https://lists.apache.org/thread/qgjynztx70fhz7h86o6dfopv14dtgrc2

* New, faster, streaming, more robust JSON result set reader.
   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-2302
   Contribution from Claus Stadler

* JENA-2315, JENA-2316 -- SHACL fixes (Jakub Wach)

* Improvement to GitHub actions :: @neilnaveen

== JSON-LD 1.1

* JSON-LD 1.1 is the default for parsing and writing JSON-LD

Apache Jena uses titanium-json-ld:
   https://github.com/filip26/titanium-json-ld

JSON-LD 1.1 is largely compatible with JSON-LD 1.0.

The JSON-LD working group listed the visible changes:
https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#changes-from-10

If you find JSON-LD has changed in the triples generated, you can test 
JSON-LD 1.0 compared to  1.1 with the json-ld.org playground:

   https://json-ld.org/playground/

==== Apache Jena 4.4.0
Released: 2022-02-02
Announcement:
https://lists.apache.org/thread/6dp7ogjhj09qon25fx2jsfgk3ljff9hj

The Apache Jena development community is pleased to
announce the release of Apache Jena 4.4.0.

== New Fuseki UI

The main item in this release is the updated Fuseki UI thanks to work by 
Bruno.  The UI has been rewritten for improved maintenance and style. We 
look forward to evolving this new code base.

== Dependency Updates

   Apache log4j is at 2.17.1
   Apache Lucene: is updated to 8.10.1 -> 8.11.1
   Titanium JSON-LD updated 1.1.0 -> 1.2.0

as well as all other dependences being checked for updates.

== Community Contributions

Erich Bremer
Jan Martin Keil

== Fuseki war file

The war file for Fuseki is no longer in the apache-jena-fuseki zip 
download. Instead, it is available from the downloads page.

https://jena.apache.org/download/

This halves the size of the zip/tar.gz for the standalone server.

The Fuseki war file does not work in Tomcat10 due to the javax->jakarta 
switchover. Apache Tomcat provide a converter:
https://tomcat.apache.org/download-migration.cgi

== Fuseki: HTML file upload support

Fuseki: serviceUpload (HTML file upload only service) is no longer added 
in a default configuration.  Existing configurations are unaffected.

This is not SPARQL GSP.

GSP (POST/PUT) endpoint accepts HTML file uploads as well as the usual 
direct POST/PUT with content-type.

== Improved bulk loader

This release includes the version of the TDB2 xloader for very large 
datasets.

It has been used to load 16.6B triples (WikiData all) into TDB2 and 
loading truthy (6B) on modest hardware. Thanks to Marco, Lorenz and 
√òyvind for running Wikidata load trails.

The loader now now has "--threads=" which been reported to give improved 
load times  (if the server has the hardware!).

== Assembler for GeoSPARQL

This makes it easier to use GeoPSARQL in a plain Fuseki.

==== Apache Jena 4.3.2
Released: 2021-12-19
Annoucement:
https://lists.apache.org/thread/nh7mctmcx7yhjh3krjyy9jcfy9zdwqmb

The Apache Jena development community is pleased to
announce the release of Apache Jena 4.3.2.

This release updates the version of log4j2 used
in Fuseki to version 2.16.0 of log4j2.

Fuseki users should upgrade as soon as possible.

Uses of Jena libraries should to check their application logging 
dependences and update as necessary.

== Changes

JENA-2214: Upgrade to Log4j2 2.16.0

JENA-2216: Fuseki/GeoSPARQL startup fix.
JENA-2215: Fix inclusion of log4j in the Fuseki war file.

Released: 2021-12-09
Annoucement:
https://lists.apache.org/thread/j6xqhbzxw9ct0owl5ghd8zrpz9lqn5pl

* java.net.http

There is a change to use JDK java.net.http package for HTTP. This 
affects HTTP authentication.

See notes below.

* JENA-2125: Internal reorganisation of SPARQL APIs.

Coupled with the change to use java.net.http, new patterns for working 
with SPARQL have been added.

https://jena.apache.org/documentation/sparql-apis/#changes

* JENA-2175: xloader

There is a new experimental bulk loader for TDB2 "xloader" and TDB1 
tdblaoder2 is rename xloader. The TDB2 is better.

The target is being able to load large data on modest hardware. For 
example, 1B triples and beyond, loading to disk rather than SSD. It is 
reliable, rather than fast.

https://jena.staged.apache.org/documentation/tdb/tdb-xloader.html

tdb2.xloader is still in development to reduce its requirements for 
intermediate disk space - please provide feedback, positive and negative.

== Notes

* HTTP usage provided by the JDK java.net.http package, with
challenge-based authentication provided on top by Jena.

* Execution objects (QueryExecution, UpdateExecution, RDFConnection)
have a companion builders for detailed configuration. Previous factory 
classes remain but builders are preferred.

This is especially important for HTTP as there many configuration
options that may be needed (including template queries).

* Timeouts - remote only supports the overall query execution. 
(connection timeout on HttpClient but due to connection caching and now 
HTTP/2 it is unclear how meaningful that is per request)

* HTTP/2 support (comes from using java.net.http package)

https://s.apache.org/jena-4.0.0-jira

== Notes

Lucene:

This is a major version number upgrade. Apache Lucene policy is 
generally "two major versions" so if your text index was created awhile 
ago, you may need to reload even if you have been upgrading Jena itself.

     https://lucene.apache.org/core/8_8_0/MIGRATE.html

IRIs:

There is a new internal API for working with different IRI implementations.

The implementation in Jena 4.0.0 is the same as Jena3 jena-iri.

There a some areas to be aware of for future changes:

+ %ZZ (%-and non-hex digits) are illegal syntax in IRIs.
   It has never been legal in the RFCs but could be read in.

+ urn: The correct form of a URN, by the RFC definition, is
   urn:NID:NSS where NID is at least two characters and NSS is at least
   one character.

   <urn:x:abcd> is illegal as is <urn:abc:>
   These are not rejected by Jena 4.0.0 but be warned!

If you have custom URIs schemes, please ensure they match the syntax of 
RFC 3986/3987.

     GraphMemBase - a common base class for GraphMem and SmallGraphMem.
     Any GraphMemBase maintains a reference count, set to one when it is created,
     and incremented by the method <code>openAgain()</code>. When the graph 
     is closed, the count is decrememented, and when it reaches 0, the tables are 
     trashed and GraphBase.close() called. Thus in normal use one close is enough,
     but GraphMakers using GraphMems can arrange to re-use the same named 
     graph.

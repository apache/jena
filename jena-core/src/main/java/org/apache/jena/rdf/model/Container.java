/** An RDF Container.
 *
 * <p>This interface defines methods for accessing RDF container resources.
 * These methods operate on the RDF statements contained in a model.  The 
 * container implementation may cache state from the underlying model, so
 * objects should not be added to or removed from the container by directly
 * manipulating its properties, whilst the container is being
 * accessed through this interface.</p>
 *
 * <p>When a member is deleted from a container using this interface, or an
 * iterator returned through this interface, all the other members with
 * higher ordinals are renumbered using an algorithm which may depend on the
 * type of the container.</p>
 *
 * <p>This interface provides methods supporting typed literals.  This means
 *    that methods are provided which will translate a built in type, or an
 *    object to an RDF Literal.  This translation is done by invoking the
 *    <CODE>toString()</CODE> method of the object, or its built in equivalent.
 *    The reverse translation is also supported.  This is built in for built
 *    in types.  Factory objects, provided by the application, are used
 *    for application objects.</p>
 * <p>This interface provides methods for supporting enhanced resources.  An
 *    enhanced resource is a resource to which the application has added
 *    behaviour.  RDF containers are examples of enhanced resources built in
 *    to this package.  Enhanced resources are supported by encapsulating a
 *    resource created by an implementation in another class which adds
 *    the extra behaviour.  Factory objects are used to construct such
 *    enhanced resources.</p>

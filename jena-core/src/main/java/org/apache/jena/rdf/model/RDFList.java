/**
 * <p>
 * Provides a convenience encapsulation for lists formed from chains of RDF
 * statements arranged to form a head/tail cons-cell structure.  The properties
 * that form the links between cells, and from cells to values, are specified by
 * a vocabulary interface, so this abstraction is designed to cope equally well
 * with DAML lists, RDF lists, and user-defined lists.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A well-formed list has cells that are made up of three statements: one
 * denoting the <code>rdf:type</code> of the list cell, one denoting the link
 * to the value of the list at that point, and one pointing to the list tail. If
 * a list cell is not well-formed, list operations may fail in unpredictable
 * ways. However, to explicitly check that the list is well-formed at all times
 * is expensive.  Therefore the list operates in two modes: in <i>strict</i>
 * mode, the well-formedness of the list is checked at the start of each list
 * operation, and an {@link InvalidListException} is thrown if the list is not
 * well- formed. This ensures that list operations are safe, but will slow down
 * processing. In <i>non-strict</i> mode, this checking is switched off, but can
 * be invoked explicitly by clients by calling {@link #isValid}. By default, RDF
 * lists are processed in non-strict mode.

/** A general selector class for use when querying models.
 * 
 * <p>OBSOLETE: use SimpleSelector. This implementation is a stub that provides
 * only constructors.
 * 
 * <p>An instance of this class is passed with query calls to models.  The model
 * will use the <CODE>test</CODE> method of this class to decide whether
 * a statement should be included in the selection.</p>
 * <p>Instances of this class can be provided with subject, predicate and object
 *   constraints.  If a subject, a predicate or an object are provided,
 *   the model implementation <b>may</b> restrict the statements that it tests
 *   to statements whose subject, predicate and object match those provided in
 *   the constructor.  This can provide for considerably more efficient
 * searching.  However, the model implementation is not required to do this.
 *  If no subject, predicate or object are provided in
 * the constructor, then all statements in the model must be tested.</p>
 * <p>This class is designed to be subclassed by the application, defining
 * defining further selection criteria of its own by providing its own
 * <CODE>selects</CODE> method.</p>
 * <p>The <CODE>test</CODE> method first verifies that a statement satisfies
 * any subject, predicate or object constraints and the calls the <CODE>
 * selects</CODE> method to test for any application supplied constraint.  The
 * default <CODE>selects</CODE> method simply returns true.</p>

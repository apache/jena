/**
 * <p>
 * An enhanced view of a Jena model that is known to contain ontology
 * data, under a given ontology {@link Profile vocabulary} (such as OWL).
 * This class does not by itself compute the deductive extension of the graph
 * under the semantic rules of the language.  Instead, we wrap an underlying
 * model with this ontology interface, that presents a convenience syntax for accessing
 * the language elements. Depending on the inference capability of the underlying model,
 * the OntModel will appear to contain more or less triples. For example, if
 * this class is used to wrap a plain memory or database model, only the
 * relationships asserted by the document will be reported through this
 * convenience API. Alternatively, if the OntModel wraps an OWL inferencing model,
 * the inferred triples from the extension will be reported as well. For
 * example, assume the following ontology fragment:
 * <code><pre>
 *      :A rdf:type owl:Class .
 *      :B rdf:type owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf :A .
 *      :widget rdf:type :B .
 * </pre></code>
 * In a non-inferencing model, the <code>rdf:type</code> of the widget will be
 * reported as class <code>:B</code> only.  In a model that can process the OWL
 * semantics, the widget's types will include <code>:B</code>, <code>:A</code>,
 * and <code>owl:Thing</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> that <code>OntModel</code> is an extension to the
 * {@link InfModel} interface.  This is to support the case where an ontology model
 * wraps an inference graph, and we want to make the special capabilities of the
 * <code>InfModel</code>, for example global consistency checking, accessible to
 * client programs.  Since not all ont models use a reasoner, using these methods
 * may result in a runtime exception, though the typical behaviour is that such
 * calls will be silently ignored.
 * </p>

     * <p><strong>Note</strong> This method searches for nodes in the underlying model whose

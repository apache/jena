     * distinguishing extra parameter for this method is the flag <code>direct</code>
     * that allows some selectivity over the classes that appear in the iterator.
     * Consider the following scenario:
     * <code><pre>
     *   :B rdfs:subClassOf :A.
     *   :C rdfs:subClassOf :A.
     *   :D rdfs:subClassof :C.
     * </pre></code>
     * (so A has two sub-classes, B and C, and C has sub-class D).  In a raw model, with
     * no inference support, listing the sub-classes of A will answer B and C.  In an
     * inferencing model, <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> is known to be transitive, so
     * the sub-classes iterator will include D.  The <code>direct</code> sub-classes
     * are those members of the closure of the subClassOf relation, restricted to classes that
     * cannot be reached by a longer route, i.e. the ones that are <em>directly</em> adjacent
     * to the given root.  Thus, the direct sub-classes of A are B and C only, and not D -
     * even in an inferencing graph.  Note that this is not the same as the entailments
     * from the raw graph. Suppose we add to this example:
     * <code><pre>
     *   :D rdfs:subClassof :A.
     * </pre></code>
     * Now, in the raw graph, A has sub-class C.  But the direct sub-classes of A remain
     * B and C, since there is a longer path A-C-D that means that D is not a direct sub-class
     * of A.  The assertion in the raw graph that A has sub-class D is essentially redundant,
     * since this can be inferred from the closure of the graph.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> This is is a change from the behaviour of Jena 1, which took a
     * parameter <code>closed</code> to compute the closure over transitivity and equivalence
     * of sub-classes.  The closure capability in Jena2 is determined by the inference engine
     * that is wrapped with the ontology model.  The direct parameter is provided to allow,
     * for example, a level-by-level traversal of the class hierarchy, starting at some given
     * root. Observe that in Jena 1, passing <code>true</code> will tend to increase the number of
     * results returned; in Jena 2 passing <code>true</code> will tend to reduce the number
     * of results.

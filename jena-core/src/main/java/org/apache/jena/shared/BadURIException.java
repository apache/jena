/**
    A Jena exception for malformed URIs. 
    <p>
    Jena checks URIs sometimes, particularly on input and output.
    It is however possible to have a Jena model which contains
    bad URIs. Such a model cannot be written out very easily,
    particularly in RDF/XML, try N-TRIPLE.
    An input document, particularly when no base URL is known,
    may introduce relative URIs into a model. These may later
    cause this exception.
    <p>
    (This one is an unchecked
    exception, so we don't litter our code with try-catch blocks or throws
    declarations.)

## Vocabularies are often just local copies of
## vocabularies published by others.
**/vocabularies/*

## Javadoc add-ons files are required to be simple and our javadoc configuration
## will ensure appropriate license and copyright statements are inserted
## into generated documentation anyway so no need to put license statements
## in these files

**/src/main/**/*.html

## Text and Markdown files are typically used only for documentation purposes
## and license declarations are usually spurious in these files since often they
## will refer to the LICENSE/NOTICE for users to find the actual licenses
**/*.txt
**/*.md

## No comments in JSON
**/*.json
**/*.srj
            
## META-INF services files can include comments but these are very small
## A license header would be confusion.

## Jena historically has large numbers of small test file
## with no license headers.  Such small files are not required 
## to have headers. 
## 
## In addition, there are files with different Licenses
## (e.g. W3C Software Licence, W3C Test Suite License) as
## noted in the code tree.

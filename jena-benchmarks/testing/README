==== jena-benchmark-jmh

The jena source release does not include large binary files.

The file "testing/data.nt.gz" is a placeholder for a large file for JMH testing. The file
name is known in various "Test*" classes.

Replace the file with a file of your choice, e.g. for BSBM - create "bsbm-5m.nt.gz".

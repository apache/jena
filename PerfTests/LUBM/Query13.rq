# - Property hasAlumnus is defined in the benchmark ontology as the inverse of property degreeFrom, which has three subproperties: undergraduateDegreeFrom, mastersDegreeFrom, and doctoralDegreeFrom. The benchmark data state a person as an alumnus of a university using one of these three subproperties instead of hasAlumnus. Therefore, this query assumes subPropertyOf relationships between degreeFrom and its subproperties, and also requires inference about inverseOf.

In both case, the results are alterted.  See the two results files

2/ ARQ/Sort/sort-2.rq => sort-result-2.ttl
3/ ARQ/Sort/sort-3.rq => sort-result-3.ttl

query and results changed (data must be changed for stable results).


4/ "Strings: Distinct"
ARQ/Distinct/
  distinct-1.rq + <data-str.ttl>
  => distinct-str.srx

5/ "All: Distinct"
ARQ/Distinct/
  distinct-1.rq + <data-num.ttl> , <data-str.ttl> , <data-node.ttl> 
  => <distinct-all.srx>

# RDF Test Suites

This test suite is a product previous RDF working groups, the [RDF & SPARQL Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/rdf-star/), and has been maintained by the [RDF Test Curation Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/rdf-tests/).

Community maintained at https://github.com/w3c/rdf-tests/tree/main/rdf.

Conformance with RDF 1.1 specifications can be determined via successfully running the [rdf11](rdf11/) tests for relevant specifications.

Conformance with RDF 1.2 specifications requires passing both the  [rdf11](rdf11/) tests and the  [rdf12](rdf12/) tests for relevant specifications.

* [rdf12](rdf12/)
* [rdf11](rdf11/)

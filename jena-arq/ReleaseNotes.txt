ChangeLog for ARQ
=================
(the list covers new features and refinements.  See ASF JIRA for details of bugs fixed) 

==== Jena 2.12.1

+ JENA-768 : Add "--out" to the "riot" command to choose a 
             different output format.
+ JENA-769 : StreamWriter, a place to get an output class that streams.
             This supplements RDFDataMgr.
+ JENA-767 : Fix the JSON parser to handle \b escapes.
+ JENA-762 : Provide a registry for result set readers and writers. 
+ JENA-761 : Provide a means to disable SERVICE 

==== Jena 2.12.0

Jena now requires Java7 as of this version.
At the same time some classes and methods previous deprecated and marked
for removal have now been removed.

QueryExecution is now AutoCloeable and can be used with try-resource.

+ JENA-694 : Require Java 7
+ JENA-714 : Source language upgrades 
+ JENA-726 : remove deprecated classes and methods.
+ JENA-727 : Checks on ResultSet from execSelect that it is still valid/

+ JENA-710 : Bug fix for filter optimizer where the filter only 
             mentions a variable onl yused with GRAPH.
+ JENA-723 : Bug fix in TopN optimization revealed in Java8 
+ JENA-715 : Read payload for errors in HttpOp 
+ JENA-713 : Reduce costly string operations in utility class 
+ JENA-712 : ARQ outputs BASE if expclitily set in a query else
             does not produce relative URIs. This is now consistent 
             with behaviour of RIOT writers.

==== Jena 2.11.2

+ JENA-631 : rdfs:member supported in property paths.
+ JENA-671 : More filter placement optimization
	See also JENA-619, JENA-627, JENA-628, JENA-653
+ JENA-638 : Improve coverage of TopN optimziation
+ JENA-634 : Add JSON-LD support
+ JENA-518 : Add getter/setter for the error handler to ReaderRIOT.
+ JENA-688 : Update N-Triples and N-Quad parsers to UTF-8 instead of ASCII to match RDF 1.1 W3C Recommendation in all cases
+ JENA-692 : Fix for a case where implicit join optimisations could break the query
+ JENA-695 : SPARQL CSV parser 
+ JENA-630 : Add constant folding to query optimisation
+ JENA-637 : Fix for bug in rdfs:member property function
+ JENA-663 : Prefer Turtle when communicating with SPARQL Graph Store Protocol endpoints

+ JENA-697 : Property function to split a string into multiple bindings (apf:strSplit)

==== Jena 2.11.1

RDF 1.1 Language support (Turtle, TriG, N-Triples, N-Quads)

+ JENA-595 : Improved filter placement optimization.
  See also JENA-293, JENA-383, JENA-432, JENA-616

+ JENA-606 : URIs for prefixes are resolved (made absolute) before adding
             to a models prefix mapping. Previously, they were left as
             relative, ifrelative URis in the document.
+ Fix a couple of possible deadlock conditions when using PipedRDFIterator

==== Jena 2.11.0

+ Support draft RDF 1.1 TriG
  GRAPH keyword, bnodes for graph labels, no "<g> = {}".
+ JENA-500 : Substitution for an initial binding is now done 
             on the algrebra before optimzation is attempted.
+ JENA-470 : Enable optimization of mixtures of disjunctions with equality 
             and other expressions.

==== Jena 2.10.1

+ JENA-352 : Solution to parsing N-Triples with any number of bnode labels.
+ RIOT is the main way to write RDF data.
  All the writers for Turtle/TriG/N-triples and N-Quads revised.
  http://jena.apache.org/documentation/io/
+ Improve ParameterizedSparqlString to prevent some identified SPARQL Injection attacks, revised the
  javadoc to note that these protections are not foolproof and that there are known attack vectors.
  Users relying this to prevent SPARQL injection are advised to add their own validation in addition
  to those that the class provides.
+ JENA-429 : Top level BIND may not be restored correctly by OpAsQuery when algebra involves grouping
+ JENA-405 : QueryEngineHTTP respects ServiceContext and uses it to pre-populate authentication and
  behaviour settings appropriate to the service used where set
+ JENA-422 : SERVICE clause now propagates top level BIND within the query pattern
+ JENA-419 : Calculating a project expression on result of aggregation is no longer incorrectly reported
  as a scope error
+ JENA-389 : Correct variable scoping transformations of FILTER NOT EXISTS within subquery
+ JENA-423 : Ensure that query iterators that were previously left open in certain circumstances are 
  now closed
+ New ResultSetPeekable interface extends ResultSet with peeking capabilities, ResultSetMem implements
  this and ResultSetPeeking is provided as an implementing wrapper over an arbitrary ResultSet
+ JENA-441 : New optimizations for ORDER BY + DISTINCT/REDUCED combinations that gives substantially better
  performance for some queries

==== Jena 2.10.0

+ Consolidation of versions numbers.
+ Command line SPARQL query reads all data formats (triples and quads) for --data 
+ RIOT is the main way to read RDF data. Includes content negotiation and file extension interpretation.
  See RDFDataMgr for methods to read RDF (triple and quads formats). 
  Model.read(...) operations use RIOT by default. 

+ Added DatasetAccessor interface to com.hp.hpl.jena - The SPARQL Graph Store Protocol  
* JENA-379 : Incorrect results from a property paths with same subject and object variable.  
+ Introduce RDFParserOutput as output interface for parsers (was Sink<Triple> or Sink<Quad>)
  Assorted implementations of this new interface
+ RIOT - internal reorganisation moving to org.apache.jena.riot.
+ Remove the partial migration support for old-style SPARQL submission update forms.
+ Update Turtle/Trig parsers for prefixed name details in RDF 1.1
  Add %-sequences, \char sequences and ':' to local part of prefixed names.
  NB.  The characters 123. are now an integer 123 and a DOT; they were a decimal, and no DOT.  
+ RIOT tokenizing now records the subtokens for language and datatype literals.   
+ JENA-345 : execConstructTriples() now excludes malformed triples (e.g. literal subjects) from it's output
+ Internal reorgansiation of packages
  org.openjena.atlas moved to org.apache.jena.atlas
+ PipedRDFStream and PipedRDFIterator replace RIOTParserPuller as method for getting
  an iterator over parser output
+ PrefixMap is now an interface
  Use PrefixMapFactory as the primary means of creating prefix maps
  Abbreviation performance for common namespace patterns (/ or # terminated) much improved
+ New FastAbbreviatingPrefixMap, can be much faster for abbreviation when namespaces
  do not follow common patterns
+ JENA-330 : Streaming support for SPARQL Update queries and streaming support for quads in INSERT DATA / DELETE DATA queries
  (Note to 3rd party storage engine implementers, the internal API for UpdateEngine has changed, see UpdateEngineMain or
  UpdateEngineNonStreaming for example of the new design)
+ SPARQL Update execution no longer supports setting an initial binding

==== ARQ 2.9.4

+ Deprecate syntax support for SPARQL/Update (the W3C submission - this is not SPARQL 1.1 Update)
  for several cycles of migration support only.  
+ Blank node labels can not be reused across different INSERT DATA operations in the same SPARQL Update Request
  (spec clarification) 
+ JENA-322 : Make jcl-over-slf4 a required dependency
+ JENA-321 : Remove GraphStore.(start|finish)Request() (was previously deprecated)
+ Remove deprecated QueryExecutionBase.cancelAllowDrain (see JENA-93)
+ Implement SPARQL-WG decision on BIND : use original semantics. 
+ JENA-294 : improved optimization of sequeneces of OPTIONALs where the group is only OPTIONAL and an equality filter
+ JENA-298 ResultSetStAX.hasNext() can now be called again after it has returned false
+ JENA-302 Add URIs for all XQuery/Xpath F&O functions for duration accessors
+ JENA-303 Add URIs for all XQuery/Xpath F&O functions where there are SPARQL functions

  Also many internal operations marked deprecated were removed.

==== ARQ 2.9.2

+ Significant speed-up of MINUS queries (JENA-266) : contribution from Paul Gearon (@quoll). 
+ Log warning messages generated by failures in SERVICE clauses now include the URI of the
  service that failed (JENA-269) : suggestion by Claude Warren
+ Support for dynamic function invocation built-in CALL() when using ARQ language

==== ARQ 2.9.1

+ SPARQL 1.1: STRBEFORE and STRAFTER return simple empty string on no match.
+ Stop multiple SERVICE calls locking Fuseki up (JENA-248)
+ (internal) DatasetPrefixStorage : change removeFromPrefixMap(String, String, String) to removeFromPrefixMap(String, String)
+ Changes for BINDINGS (SPARQL 1.1) - align with SPARQL-WG
  Now called VALUES : slight syntax changes.
  VALUES can be inline data as part of a query pattern.  
+ Comprehensive support for date/time/durations operations (JENA-235)
+ Property path syntax revised to align with current SPARQL
  No {...} forms in SPARQL query engine (available in ARQ language)
+ Property path semantics revised to align with current SPARQL
  *, + and ? are connectivity/non-counting
+ New property path evaluation engine framework.
+ Bug fix: DISTINCT might not be distinct (JENA-211)
+ QueryEngineHttp has configuration options (JENA-210)
+ Add function "StrUUID" which returns a UUID string (c.f. "UUID()" for a UUID as a URI of form <urn:uuid:....>)
  Also available as afn:struuid() and afn:uuid() for strict syntax. 
+ Add UpdateExecutionFactory.createRemote(...) for remote execution of SPARQL Update (JENA-197) 
+ Allow users to specify query parameters in SERVICE
  Allow the context to include a set of parameters add to SERVICE requests  
  (JENA-195)
+ SPARQL 1.1: Complete scope tracking of variables (JENA-142)
+ SPARQL/Trutle alignment: Prefix names can contain ':' unescaped.  No escape for ':' 
+ Faster writing of XML and JSON results formats (JENA-178)
+ Support for SERVICE with additional parameters (JENA-195)  

==== ARQ 2.8.9 / 2.9.0
** Java 6 is now required for running ARQ.

+ SPARQL 1.1: Provides \-escapes for characters ~.-!$&'()*+,;=:/?#@% 
              in local part of prefix names 
+ SPARQl 1.1: Allow %xx in the local part of prefix names
+ SPARQL 1.1 / RDF 1.1 : DATATYPE(literal-with-lang) is now rdf:langString, not an error.
+ DatasetFactory: preferred methods for an in-memory dataset are:
     create() -- will automatically add in-memory named graphs  
     createFixed() -- needs explicitly added extra graph  
+ BUG FIX: Mis-execution of GRAPH ?g { .. } where ?g used inside { .. } (JENA-154)
+ Bug fix: ResourceUtils.renameResource() no longer uses Iterator.remove() (JENA-76)
+ Bug fix: Query objects with aggregators cannot be reused (JENA-120)
+ REGEX now accepts xsd:string and literals with language tags in the first argument. 
+ Add function STRBEFORE, STRAFTER and REPLACE for SPARQL 1.1
+ Add function UUID  [ARQ language only]  
+ Remove LARQ from ARQ.  LARQ is now a separate Jena module.
+ Fix reuse of query objects (aggregation used shared state) (JENA-121)
+ Spill to disk update (enable with ARQ.spillToDiskThreshold) (JENA-45)
+ External sort (enable with ARQ.spillToDiskThreshold) (JENA-44) 
+ Remove RDQL from ARQ (code in Archive/ in SVN -- will not be updated) 
+ ResultSetUtils.union(ResultSet ... sets)
+ Add optimization for DISTINCT/ORDER BY/LIMIT N (JENA-108)
+ Add optimization for DISTINCT/ORDER BY (JENA-90)
+ Add optimization for ORDER BY/LIMIT N (JENA-89)
+ General upgrade of dependent systems (not Lucene - see LARQ module for use with Lucene 3)
+ Introduce "bindings IO", a subsystem for efficient reading and writing of result bindings. 
+ Make CONCAT follow the SPARQL 1.1 spec properly. 
+ Bug fix: ORDER BY and FILTERs in sub-selects didn't work if ordering by non-SELECT variables.
+ Bug fix: Equality of algebra operator (order) wasn't checkign all aspects of the op.
+ Bug fix: SUM and AVG over errors didn't generate an error as they should do.
+ Add TSVInput processor (JENA-69 / Laurent Pellegrino) 
+ Added DatasetGraph.add(g,s,p,o) and .delete(g,s,p,o) (JENA-65)
+ Aggregates COUNT(?x) and COUNT(DISTINCT ?x) now skips errors in their expressions
  rather than evaluating to an error (SPARQL 1.1 Query Last Call compliance).   

==== ARQ 2.8.8

+ Added QueryExecution.setTimeout that uses the abort mechanism below to stop queries after
  a preset period of time.

+ Query cancellation: method for QueryExecution.abort() can now be called by any thread at any time.
  The effect is to stop the query execution as soon as possible.
  After calling .abort(), at some time. .hasNext() and .next() will throw an exception if called.
  Exactly when this happens is not defined - it may be immediately.

+ "arq.update --dump" : Output is now N-quads.

+ riot command: Output now abbreviates bNode labels.

+ SPARQL 1.1: Behaviour change: aggregates where the accumulation cause an error now cause the 
  AVG of 1,"two", 3 is now an error, was "two" is skipped
  (and most likely, the error causes unbound in the SELECT expression) 

+ Bug fix: Handling of UNDEF in BINDINGS

+ RIOT: Better handling of file names with spaces in them for base URI. 

+ Notice: A separate LARQ module is under development - this will use Lucene 3.x.y 

+ Bug fix: RIOT: Cope with UTF-8 files with a BOM.

+ Add scope checking rules as required by SPARQL 1.1
  Illegal in SPARQL 1.1:
     Reuse of variables in assignments (i.e. "AS ?x" and ?x potentially bound)
     SELECT * {} GROUP BY (reamins legal in ARQ language)

+ Bug fix: FILTERs did not always get moved to the end of groups properly 
           (sometimes only to end of BGPs). 
           This effects some FILTER the LET combinations using the same variable.  

==== ARQ 2.8.7

SPARQL 1.1 Function library:
 + Added MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256 SHA384, SHA512 functions for SPARQL 1.1
 + Added YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOURS, MINUTES, SECONDS to SPARQL 1.1
   TIMEZONE awaiting WG discussions.
 + Added NOW() to SPARQL 1.1 - filter function like afn:now().

==== ARQ 2.8.6

** Update is now two languages: 
     strict SPARQL 1.1 Update (the default)
     enhanced language (ARQ query extensions, compatibility extensions for previous update language)
   Set Syntx.syntaxARQ_Update to access the extensions. 

+ Complete implementation of SPARQL 1.1 Query and Update (as per current draft) 
  Default query and updates languages are now SPARQL 1.1

+ Syntax extensions for W3C submission "SPARQL Update"
  http://seaborne.blogspot.com/2010/08/migrating-from-sparql-update-submission.html

+ RIOT commands (ntrig, nquads, turtle, ntriples, infer) now in package 'riotcmd'

+ Expand update API to support multiple languages
  See src-examples/arq.update.* for examples of API.

+ UpdateException now used for errors during update execution (potentially visible change)   

+ Bug fix: compound expressions involving aggregates in SELECT clause

+ Remove use of code from org.json to clarify legal position. 

+ Property path evaluation now aligns with SPARQL 1.1 
	cardinality of results for arbitary length paths may change.   

+ Bug fix: N-Triples, and N-Quads now expect ASCII input as per specs.  

+ Bug fix: Property functions in FILTER NOT EXISTS

==== ARQ 2.8.5

+ RIOT: New parsers covering N-triples, N-Quads, Turtle and TriG
  URI and literal checking in Trutle amd TriG. 
  New command line tools:
    arq.riot (parse based on file ext), arq.ntriple, arq.nquads, arq.turtle, arq.trig
    Parse files to N-Triples/N-Quads.
    By default, checking turned on for N-triples and N_quads when useNd at command line.  

+ Import all of atlas and riot subsystems from TDB
  These will become submodules of ARQ sometime.
  Atlas contains all non-RDF related library code.

+ SPARQL 1.1 status:
    SPARQL 1.1 Query: implemented except for corner cases of property paths
      Use Syntax.syntaxSPARQL_11
    SPARQL 1.1 Update: Only W3C submission supported for execution.
      Someparsing of WG design for SPARQL 1.1. Update but (at time or release) language not agreed. 

+ Bug fixes:
  Parsing of UNION in non-SPARQL 1.0 queries.
  False optimization of GRAPH when mixed with extra {} and FILTERs.

==== ARQ 2.8.4

+ Internal reorganisation of graph-level DatasetGraph (no chnages to the application API)
  There is now hanlding of quads,
  The difference bewteen DatasetGraph and DataSourceGraph is removed.
  New classes to help with DatasetGraphs which are collections of graphs and 
  ones that are colelctions of quads and triples.  
  This does not affect Dataset or DataSource, the API interfaces.     
+ Add BNODE() function to generate fresh bnodes

==== ARQ 2.8.3

+ Added commands arq.larq and arq.larqbuilder to query and build Lucense indexes for ARQ.
+ Added IN and NOT IN operators
+ Added IF and COALESCE operators
+ Add built-in function STRLANG(string, string) to make a literal with a language tag.
+ Add built-in function STRDT(string, iri) to make a literal with datatype
+ Add built-in function IRI(string) to make an IRI.
+ Add value support for xsd:gYear/gYearMonth/gMonth/gMonthDay/gDay 
+ Results output in CSV and TSV.
+ Add "negative property classed" (experimental)
  !rdf:type matches anything except rdf:type
  !(rdf:type|rdfs:label) matches some thing that isn't rdf:type or rdfs:label
+ Bug fix: some multiply nested OPTIONALs could result in only naive, unoptimized execution. 
+ Bug fix: SERVICE body for complex query patterns.
+ Bug fix: XML literals in SPARQL XML Results had the end of lines mangled. 

==== ARQ 2.8.2

+ SPARQL v1.1 as an defined language and parser, separate from ARQ 
+ Results output in CSV
+ Optimization of disjunction FILTERs 
    with care to get same effects if value-based
    URIs are always safe to optimize. 
+ Bug fix in filter placement (in code used by TDB only) 
+ Bug fix in filter equality transformation if involving unused an variable.

==== ARQ 2.8.1

+ Bug fixes
   + substitution in NOT EXISTS
   + substitution in assignment
   + constant folding and logical special forms
   + bad lock allocation (only occurs under very high load)

+ Speed up processing of nested optionals.  Greatly speeds up BSBM with TDB.

+ Some JMX management exposed: Object names start "com.hp.hpl.jena.sparql". 
  Details include: system and version information, query execution count, 
    last query and the time execution started.

==== ARQ 2.8.0

+ Build is now done by maven
** JAR changes: the ARQ jars are now called "arq.jar" and "arq-tests.jar".
   Only "arq.jar is needed at runtime unless running ARQ test code. 
** There is only one maven artifact "arq".  "arq-extra" is no more.
  See README for deatils of files produced.

+ Negation-as-failure: NOT EXISTS {pattern}
  see http://jena.sf.net/ARQ/negation.html for details.

+ Bug fix: Reverse paths of length 3 or more were not being parsed correctly.

+ Upgrade to stax 1.0.1 and wstx-asl-3.2.9

+ Remove json.jar (jena compiled code from org.json).  Replace with source code, renamed, in ARQ itself. 
  package com.hp.hpl.jena.sparql.lib.org.json;
  Cleaned up for Java generics.

==== ARQ 2.7.0

+ New build system.

+ Clearing up.
    junit used is now v4.5
    internal logging API is SLF4J (Jena uses SLF4J as of v 2.6.0 as well)
    Jars needed:  slf4j-api-1.5.6.jar and (for log4j) slf4j-log4j12-1.5.6.jar
    
+ Optimizer framework rewritten (inc support for hooks used by TDB).
  New general purpose StateGenerator and memory-graphs statistics    

+ Fix parsing of very large INSERT DATA requests (stack could overflow).

+ The IndexBuilder constructors taking a directory name as a string would 
  clear the Lucene index.  Changed so they do not do so - and behave like
  the other constructors which reuse an existing index.   

+ Uses the Java5 version of Jena2. 

+ Property function afp:versionARQ does not now split version numbers into major and minor parts
  ARQ has a 3-part version number now.

==== ARQ 2.6.0

+ Added .close() to Dataset and GraphStore for those implementations that
  need to make changes permanent or release system resources.  

+ Clean internal extensions points for TDB

+ Put misc support code in for TDB

+ Fix bug in SPARQL grammar (!) : expressions like "1+2*3" did not parse.  
  This is a fix to the grammar as published by the working group.  
   It does not invalidate or chnage any query that works - it makes some
   illegal syntax work that should work.

==== ARQ 2.5

+ Redesign of quad support. 
  AlgebraGeneratorQuad retired
  Use Algebra.toQuadForm(Op) to turn an algebra expression into quads.   

+ fn:string-join was misnamed - was actually renamed as fn:concat
  And now takes arbitrary number of arguments

+ Add afn:strjoin(str, string...) 

+ Bug fix: path parsing when "a" (for rdf:type) 
           is used in a property list (using ;) 

+ Bug fix: LET expressions did not eliminate solutions when
    assigned a new, different value.

+ Internal renaming to make the class names better reflect their role
  particularly not using the term "compile" for things now considered
  to happen during query execution.  

+ Internal utilities updated for TDB

+ Signal start/end of updates using the graph-level events mechanism.

==== ARQ 2.4

+ Change to interface for query compilation : Algebra.compile and Algebra.optimize 

+ Property paths added.  See documentation.
  
+ Simplify the interface between ARQ and data sources.
  StageGenerator example updated.   

==== ARQ 2.3

+ HAVING / ORDER BY variable, where variable is SELECT as an aggregate or computed value now works. 
  (current restriction: can't have the expression directly in the ORDER BY - need to project the variable)  

+ Upgrade to Lucene 2.3.1

+ Change return type of ResultFactor.copyResults to ResultSetRewinable (a sub interface of ResultSet).

+ Allow inital bindings for Updates (ignored unless a Modify operation)

+ Added SUM(?x) aggregate

+ Added { SELECT } (nested SELECT) and LET (assignment) to ARQ extended SPARQL.

+ Added optimization rewrite of algebra expressions for FILTER(?x = :x) and FILTER(sameTerm(?x, :x))
  so that the required term is substituted into the pattern before execution.
  Cautiously applied to basic graph patterns and quad patterns.
 
+ Bug fix: ARQ 2.2 broke property functions in many nested structures. 

+ src-examples: example of SPARQL/Update

+ Fix bug: OpUnion flattening was not happening (Main query engine, OpCompiler) 

+ Fix bug: HttQueryEngine(in HttpQuery) generated bad POST requests with a trailing &.

+ New command arq.load, which loads files into graphs.  Special case of arq.update

==== ARQ 2.2

+ Added command line tool, arq.update, for applying SPARQL/Update requests
  to a graph store or dataset described by an assembler file.

+ LARQ: 
  Remove restriction that indexes have to be closed for writing before reading
  Becare: in Lucene, reader indexes (like LARQIndexes) see the index as at the point
  in time when the index was created.  Must get a new reader to see later updates.

+ QueryEngineHTTP
  + Can be created via QueryExecutionFactory
  + Operations for adding HTTP parameters and also for basic authentication of HTTP.  

+ Added ParserRegistry (courtesy of Olaf Hartig)

+ Reworked property functions so they formally in the algebra.

+ Jar change: commons-logging-1.1.1.jar

+ Bug fix: text output of result sets sometimes gave full bNode label - revert to
  old design where a short label is used always.  

+ Bug fix: handling of empty patterns and COUNT could give no count,
  instead of a count of zero.  

+ Use base URI for realtive URI printing (i.e <foobar>)

+ Track DAWG:
  Effect of OPTIONAL {{ ... FILTER }} (must be 2 or more {{}}) changes.
  Inner {} now protects the FILTER from becoming part of the LeftJoin.  

+ Upgrade lucene-core-2.0.0.jar to lucene-2.2.0.jar
  Lucene change means that users can't mix ARQ 2.1, and before,
  with Lucene 2.1.0 or later.

==== ARQ 2.1

+ (experimental for this release - permanent in next)
  GROUP BY, HAVING
  Aggregates: count(*), count(?x), count(distinct *), count(distinct ?x)

+ (experimental for this release - permanent in next) 
  Expressions in SELECT clause
  Expression in brackets, optionally named with "AS ?var"
  Adding an explict namne is strongly encouraged especially if you use
  the SPARQL results format because internal variables variable names
  are not portable. 
    SELECT (?x+?y AS ?z) ?y ?x
    SELECT ?x ?y (?x+?y AS ?sum)  # Print a table of sums
  OpProject can have additional expressions that get added into the
    table from 'project'
  
+ removed old-style (and out-of-date) writers for internal forms: prefix,
  plain and XML forms of a SPARQL query.  The XML form was incomplete
  anyway.  (This does not affect algebra output which is what replaces
  these syntax-based forms).
  
+ Added examples of using Lisp (SISC - A Java-based scheme interpreter). 
  See the directory Lisp/. 
  
+ NodeVar renamed ExprVar (more consistent naming)
  Deprecated tombstones left for next release 

==== ARQ 2.1 beta

+ Cost-based optimizer for basic graph patterns on in-memory graphs. 
  ** Uses the version of jena shipped with this release, can't use an earlier one.   

+ Convert algebra expressions back into a SPARQL query (see OpToSyntax).

+ Old "NodeToLabelMap" => "NodeIsomorphismMap"
  Affects Element and Op ".equalTo" operation signature.

+ Added extension : a graph pattern SERVICE <serviceEndPoint> { pattern }
  ARQ syntax only.
  New algebra operation: OpService

+ Added SSE to the main codebase : http://jena.hpl.hp.com/wiki/SSE

+ Internal changes: the core engines are now Graph/DatasetGraph/Algebra-centric 
  and there are classes to map betwen that and the Model/Dataset.
  QueryEngine construction and extension need not know about
  the upper layers now.

+ Algebra operator implment .hashCode() and .equals() based on structure/value equality

+ Legacy query engine1 removed.

+ Add new algebra operations
  OpGroupAgg, OpNull
  
+ VarsMentionedVisitor removed - convert to an algebra expression and use OpVars.allVars instead.

==== ARQ 2.0

This version uses the SPARQL algebra directly,
then produces an execution scheme that uses streaming
execution where possible.

+ SPARQL changes
  + Prefixed names can now start with a digit.  ex:123 is now a legal prefix name.
  + The working group has removed attributes "ordered" and "distinct" from the
    XML Results format. These have been removed in this release.  ARQ will read
    old style XML files (and ignore the attributes).
    JSON result format also updated.

+ Multiple query engines:
  + Main query engine for optimization and efficient execution
  + Reference engine for checking functionality
    (implements the SPARQL evaluation semantics very simply for clarity and validation)
  + Remote access engine for querying SPARQL endpoints over HTTP.

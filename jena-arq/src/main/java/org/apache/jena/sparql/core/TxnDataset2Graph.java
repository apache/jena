/**
 * A {@link Transactional} that passes the transaction operations down to transactions on
 * independent graphs.
 * <p>
 * There are limitations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>we can't atomically do all the commits together in the crash situation.
 * <li>This {@code Transactional} maintains a MRSW policy because that is all that is
 * required of graphs in general.
 * </ul>
 * It does cover the important case of one graph ({@link DatasetGraphOne}) where the one
 * graph is an InfGraph and should work when the graphs in the dataset is not changing or
 * when a new memory graph is added mid-transaction.
 * <p>
 * This is not "nested transactions" - theer is no overall "commit" or "abort". If
 * failure/restart occurs, some graphs may have commited and others not. It is the best
 * that can be done given for an arbitrary collection of graphs, backed by different
 * storage and having different capabilities.
 * <p>
 * Best practice is to change the graph membership outside of any transaction,
 * ideally at setup time of the object using this class. (Caution: SPARQL Update
 * can create graphs.)   
 * @see DatasetGraphMapLink
 * @see DatasetGraphOne

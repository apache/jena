/** Convenient comma separated values - see also TSV (tab separated values)
 *  which outputs full RDF terms (in Turtle-style).
 *
 *  The CSV format supported is:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>First row is variable names without '?'</li>
 *  <li>Strings, quoted if necessary and numbers output only.
 *  No language tags, or datatypes.
 *  URIs are send without $lt;&gt;
 *  </li>
 *  CSV is RFC 4180, but there are many variations.
 *  </ul>
 *  This code reads the file and treats everything as strings.
 *  <p>
 *  The code also allows for parsing boolean results where we expect the header to be a single string
 *  from the set: true yes false no
 *  </p>
 *  <p>
 *  Any other value is considered an error for parsing a boolean results and anything past the first line is ignored

 * <pre>Txn.executeWrite(dataset, {@literal ()->} { ... sparql update ... });</pre>
 * or use one of <tt>Txn.calculateRead</tt> and <tt>Txn.executeWrite</tt>
 * to return a value for the transaction block.
 * <p>

 * <pre>
 *     Transactional object = ...
 *     object.begin(TxnMode.READ) ;
 *     try {
 *       ... actions inside a read transaction ...
 *     } finally { object.end() ; }

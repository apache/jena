     * How it works:
     * 
     * Choose the 'best' pattern, propagate the fact that variables are now
     * bound (ReorderTransformationSubstitution) then chooses the next triple
     * pattern.
     * 
     * Instead of just one set of rules, we make an exception is rdf:type. ?x
     * rdf:type :T or ?x rdf:type ?type are often very much less selective and
     * we want to give them special, poorer weighings. We do this by controlling
     * the order of matching: first check to see if it's rdf;type in the
     * predicate position, then apply the appropriate matcher.
     * 
     * If we just used a single StatsMatcher with all the rules, the
     * VAR/TERM/TERM or VAR/TERM/VAR rules match rdf:type with lower weightings.
     * 
     * The relative order of equal weightings is not changed.
     * 
     * There are two StatsMatchers: 'matcher' and 'matcherRdfType'
     * applied for the normal case and the rdf:type case.

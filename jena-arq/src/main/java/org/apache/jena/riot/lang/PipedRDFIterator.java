/**
 * <p>
 * A {@code PipedRDFIterator} should be connected to a {@link PipedRDFStream}
 * implementation; the piped iterator then provides whatever RDF primitives are
 * written to the {@code PipedRDFStream}
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Typically, data is read from a {@code PipedRDFIterator} by one thread (the
 * consumer) and data is written to the corresponding {@code PipedRDFStream} by
 * some other thread (the producer). Attempting to use both objects from a
 * single thread is not recommended, as it may deadlock the thread. The
 * {@code PipedRDFIterator} contains a buffer, decoupling read operations from
 * write operations, within limits.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Inspired by Java's {@link java.io.PipedInputStream} and
 * {@link java.io.PipedOutputStream}
 * </p>
 * 
 * @param <T>
 *            The type of the RDF primitive, should be one of {@code Triple},
 *            {@code Quad}, or {@code Tuple<Node>}

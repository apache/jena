==== SPARQL Parser

Run

    grammar

This produces the code for the current version SPARQL
and the ARQ (SPARQL with extensions) parsers.

==

To produce the HTML for the SPARQL Grammar for the W3C spec:
produce the SPARQL 1.2 specific file

    grammar

which also generates Java code and can be used for checking.

Then run

    sparql2html

The output is in sparql-grammar.html.

This replaces the table between "<!-- GRAMMAR -->" in the specific HTML.

Running

    sparql2bnf

produces a text BNF form.

An Apache Jena release includes the java generated by the protobuf compiler.
There is no need to regenerate this code in order to build Jena.

To rebuild the protobuf-generated java code:

    cd to jena-arq/Grammar/RDF-Protobuf
    run ./gen-protobuf

To install protoc: https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/

which for Linux is

    VER=...
    PB_REL="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases"
    curl -LO $PB_REL/download/v${VER}/protoc-${VER}-linux-x86_64.zip

Only the protoc compiler binary is needed.
The "include/google/protobuf" standard prototypes are not needed.

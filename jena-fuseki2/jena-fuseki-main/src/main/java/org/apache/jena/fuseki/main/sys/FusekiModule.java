/**
 * Module interface for Fuseki.
 * <p>
 * A module is additional code, usually in a separate jar, but it can be part of
 * the application code. Calls are made to each module at certain points in the
 * lifecycle of a Fuseki server.
 * <p>
 *  A module must provide a no-argument constructor if it is to be loaded automatically.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@linkplain #start()} -- called when the module is loaded.</li>
 * <li>{@linkplain #prepare}
 *      -- called at the beginning of the
 *     {@link org.apache.jena.fuseki.main.FusekiServer.Builder#build() FusekiServer.Builder build()}
 *      step. This call can manipulate the server configuration. This is the usual operation for customizing a server.</li>
 * <li>{@linkplain #configured} -- called after the DataAccessPoint registry has been built..</li>
 * <li>{@linkplain #server(FusekiServer)} -- called at the end of the "build" step.</li>
 * <li>{@linkplain #serverBeforeStarting(FusekiServer)} -- called before {@code server.start} happens.</li>
 * <li>{@linkplain #serverAfterStarting(FusekiServer)} -- called after {@code server.start} happens.</li>
 * <li>{@linkplain #serverStopped(FusekiServer)} -- call after {@code server.stop}, but only if a clean shutdown happens.
 *     Servers may simply exit without a shutdown phase.
 *     The JVM may exit or be killed without clean shutdown.
 *     Modules must not rely on a call to {@code serverStopped} happening.</li>
 * <li>{@linkplain #stop} -- modules finishes. Unlikely to be called in practice. There is no guarantee of a clean shutdown.
 * </ul>

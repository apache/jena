==== Fuseki

== Fuseki 2.0.0

Fuseki 2.0.0 is a major change to Fuseki. Se the documentation for details.

* Security, provided by Apache Shiro.
* New admin API
* New UI

Migration:

Existing installations of Fuseki should work unchanged
but some new functionality if not available to datasets
defined in the Fuseki config.ttl file.

+ Service assemblers should be placed configuration/
  one service per file.  Only this way will all features,
  particularly making a dataset offline, be available.

# Generating LICENSE and NOTICE for redistribution of the Fuseki UI.

This only needs to be done if Javascript dependencies change. The places where
the content is required are LICENSE files that are checked into git.

ASF material:
https://infra.apache.org/licensing-howto.html
https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#required-third-party-notices

For jar files, the maven-shade-plugin aggregates LICENSE and NOTICE files.

# UI code

The script make-license generates the necessary content using yarn and places it
in jena-fuseki-ui/target/ as LICENSE-UI and NOTICE-UI (if any).

NOTICE particularly should be as short as possible.

Typically, required license text goes in LICENSE. 
Links to licenses may be used.

These file are the content for the UI inclusion - they may be other content to
include so don't simply overwrite existing LICENSE and NOTICE files without
checking. The content is at the bottom of the file.

These files are included where the bundled jena-fuseki-ui is shipped.

## Fuseki Webapp

* apache-jena-fuseki/dist/LICENSE
* jena-fuseki-war/war-inclusions/META-INF/LICENSE

## Fuseki Main

(Future possibility)

If there is a Fuseki module for the UI, then that will need a LICENSE file.
That might be done automatically if the content is placed in a jar using
src/main/resource files and java jar building.

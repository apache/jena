                                  ===========

  Jena is a Java framework for building semantic web applications. It provides 
  tools and Java libraries to help you to develop semantic web and linked-data 
  apps, tools and servers.

  This distribution includes the following Apache Jena modules: 

  - jena-core: provides the Jena RDF APIs, Ontology APIs and Inference APIs. 
  - jena-arq: SPARQL 1.1, query and update.
  - jena-iri: provides an implementation of RFC 3987 (IRI) and RFC 3986 (URI)

  Installing Jena
  ---------------

   To use Jena in your application, ensure all the .jar files in the lib/
   directory are on the classpath or available to your web application. Jena
   is built and test with these .jar files.

  Scripts
  -------

  The directories bat/ and bin/ provide script wrappers to run Jena command
  line tools.  The scripts can be coppied to a convenient place on the
  command path.

  To use the Jena tools from the command line you need to set the JENAROOT
  environment variable to point to the location where you have 
  unzipped the Jena distribution:

  Windows:
    set JENAROOT \path\to\apache-jena-2.7.0-incubating
    bat\sparql.bat --version    

  Linux
    export JENAROOT=/path/to/apache-jena-2.7.0-incubating
    bin/sparql --version

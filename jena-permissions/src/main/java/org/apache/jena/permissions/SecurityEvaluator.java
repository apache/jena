/**
 * SecurityEvaluator.
 * <p>
 * The security evaluator is the link between the graph security system and an
 * external security system. This interface specifies the methods that are
 * required by the graph security system. It is assumed that the implementation
 * will handle tracking the current user and will query some underlying data
 * source to determine what actions the user can and can not take.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All questions of white listing or black listing will be handled in the
 * concrete implementation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this class should probably cache any evaluate calculations
 * as the evaluate methods are called frequently. However, the underlying
 * classes do cache results within a single method check.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Secured operations</dt>
 * <dd>The security system recognizes and secures each of the CRUD (Create,
 * Read, Update and Delete) operations as represented by the Action enumeration.
 * </dd>
 * </dl>
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Levels of security</dt>
 * <dd>The security interfaces operates at two (2) levels: graph (or Model) and
 * triple.
 * <p>
 * At the the graph level the security evaluator may restrict CRUD access to the
 * graph or model as a whole. When evaluating the restriction, if the user it
 * not permitted to perform the operation on the graph or model access is
 * denied. If the user is permitted any triple restrictions are evaluated.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * At the triple level the security evaluator may restrict CRUD access to
 * specific triples. In order to skip potentially expensive triple security
 * checks the system will generally ask if the user is permitted the CRUD action
 * on any triple. This is represented by the SecTriple
 * <code>(ANY, ANY, ANY)</code>.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * If the system does not support triple level security the system should always
 * return <code>true</code>.</li>
 * If the system does support triple level security and is unable to verify that
 * the user can execute the CRUD action against any arbitrary triple the system
 * should return <code>false</code>. </li>
 * <li>See <code>SecNode.ANY</code>, <code>SecNode.FUTURE</code>, and
 * <code>SecNode.VARIABLE</code> for discussion of specifics of their respective
 * usages.</li>
 * </ul>

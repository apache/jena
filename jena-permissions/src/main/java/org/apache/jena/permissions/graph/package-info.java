/**
 * Secured implementation of the Graph interface and associated classes.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The SecurityEvaluator class must be implemented.  This class provides the interface to the 
 * authentication results (e.g. getPrincipal())) and the authorization system.
 * </p><p>
 * Create a SecuredGraph by calling Factory.getInstance( SecurityEvaluator, String, Graph );
 * Create a SecuredModel by calling Factory.getInstance( SecurityEvaluator, String, Model ) 
 * or ModelFactory.createModelForGraph( SecuredGraph );
 * </p><p>
 * NOTE: when creating a model by wrapping a secured graph (e.g. 
 * ModelFactory.createModelForGraph( SecuredGraph );) the resulting Model does not
 * have the same security requirements that the standard secured model does. 
 * </p><p>
 * For instance when creating a list on a secured model calling model.createList( RDFNode[] ); 
 * The standard secured model verifies that the user
 * has the right to update the triples and allows or denies the entire operation accordingly.  
 * The wrapped secured graph does not have visibility
 * to the createList() command and can only operate on the instructions issued by the
 * model.createList() implementation.  In the standard implementation
 * the model requests the graph to delete one triple and then insert another.  
 * Thus the user must have delete and add permissions, not the update permission.
 * </p><p>
 * There are several other cases where the difference in the layer can trip up the security system.  
 * In all known cases the result is a tighter 
 * security definition than was requested.  For simplicity sake we recommend that the wrapped 
 * secured graph only be used in cases where access to the
 * graph as a whole is granted/denied.  In these cases the user either has all CRUD capabilities or 
 * none.
 * </p>

/**
 * Add transactionality control to an ObjectFile. ObjectFiles are "append only" so with a
 * single writer environment, we just need to manage a reset on abort. A crash in a
 * transaction will accumulate some junk in the file. This is now a tradeoff of speed and
 * space.
 * 
 * Speed : append to the original file directly and tolerate junk. This class.
 * 
 * Space : use a journal file and write to main file on commit. {@link ObjectFileTransComplex} 
 * 
 * {@link ObjectFileTransComplex} has an auxilliary file that it writes to, then copies to
 * the main file on "commit". This avoids the possibility of junk from a failed
 * transaction on a crash but costs extra writes.
 * 
 * The normal choice is this class.
